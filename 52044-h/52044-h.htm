<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85px;">
<img src="images/doodad.jpg" width="85" height="9" alt="decoration" />
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this, the third reader of the series, great care has been taken,
not only in selecting material suited to the needs and ability
of the pupil, but also to arrange the selections so that he may
develop the habit of acquiring interesting facts as he reads.</p>

<p>In the first two grades the children need to learn the mechanics
of reading,—the recognition of words, the ability to find out <i>new</i>
words for themselves by means of phonics, correct pronunciation,
enunciation, inflection, expression, etc., but in this grade especial
stress may be laid on <i>learning by reading</i>,—getting the fact and
remembering it. This prepares the pupil for the actual work of
studying, when he is given a book and asked for the first time to
“learn the lessons.” The questions at the end of many of the
lessons should be read and answered by the pupil after he has read
the selection. His answers should be thoughtfully prepared and
correctly stated.</p>

<p>Especial attention is called to the fact that the selections in this
book are almost exclusively copyrighted material, and have
never been and cannot be used in other series of readers. This
avoids the tiresome repetition of stories, read first in one book
and then again and again in others.</p>

<p>Many of the selections are valuable from a literary standpoint,
and the pupils will read with real enjoyment stories by Laura
Richards, Mary E. Wilkins, Anna von Rydingsvärd, Helen Hunt
Jackson, and other authors, noted for their skill in writing stories
for children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />6<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The selections which deal especially with child life and interests
in other countries will broaden the child’s view of the world,
prepare him for the study of geography, and help him to be a
wide awake child, just the child whom this Wide Awake Series
is intended to develop.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The selections, “Little Grandmother’s Shoes,” “Children of
a Sunny Land,” “The Little Plant,” “The Little Goatherds,”
“Great-Great-Grandma’s Christmas in England,” “The Whipping
Boy,” “The Christmas Spruce Tree,” “The Eve of St.
Nicholas,” “The Little Turkeys,” “The Children of Armenia,”
“Ahmow,—the Wolf,” “The Emperor and the Peasant,” and
“The Christmas Monks,” are used by arrangement with the
Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Company.</p>

<h2>ALL THE CHILDREN OF ALL THE WORLD</h2>


<p>I wish you would try to think this morning about
all the children in all the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i-011.jpg" width="496" height="239" alt="Japanese girl playing with a doll" />
</div>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of them, and
they are doing all sorts of things this very minute.</p>

<p>Some of them are wide awake and some are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />10<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
bed and fast asleep. Some are in school and some
are playing out of doors.</p>

<p>Some live in such hot countries that they lie in
the shade of big palm trees to keep cool. Others are
in such a cold country that they see nothing but
ice and snow, and they are dressed in furs from head
to foot.</p>

<p>When you read stories about the children in other
lands, do they seem to you like fairy stories?</p>

<p>I want you to know that all these children are real
boys and girls, and they work and play and have
happy times together, just as you do.</p>

<p>Perhaps when you read about the children in the
far North you will wish that you were an Eskimo boy,
living in a snow hut, wearing thick furs, and riding
over the fields of snow in a sled drawn by dogs.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you would rather be a little Indian
and live in a wigwam in the forest, learning to paddle
a canoe, and to fish and hunt.</p>

<p>While you are here in this beautiful schoolroom,
learning to read and write and draw and sing, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />11<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
are thousands of other children who never saw a schoolhouse,
and who will grow up to be men and women
without even learning to read.</p>

<p>You can read stories about these people, and
as you grow older perhaps you will know more
about them, but they will probably never hear of
you.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many thousands of children
everywhere who are in school this morning.</p>

<p>Think of all the boys and girls in every town in the
whole United States, who see the flag with its stars
and stripes floating over their schoolhouses, and who
learn to sing “America.”</p>

<p>In France the children wave a flag of red, white and
blue, and learn a song about their country, but their
flag is not like yours, and you could not understand
one word of their French song.</p>

<p>The little English children sing a song about their
country and their king which you could understand,
and they read in books like yours. But then, there
are the children who live in Germany, and learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />12<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
read in German, and the children who live in Italy
and read Italian books, and many, many others.</p>

<p>Oh, there are so many children in the world!</p>

<p>In Japan and China the children use the queerest
books that you ever saw. The words go up and
down the page, and the stories begin at the end of
the book, and at the bottom of the page. The words
look like this:—</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 89px;">
<img src="images/i-014.jpg" width="89" height="218" alt="Japanese writing" />
</div>

<p>Did you ever see such funny words?</p>

<p>The boys and girls in these other
countries do not go to school all of the
time. They have holidays and vacations,
and they play out of doors in the long
summer days and the cold winter
weather, just as you do.</p>

<p>You would enjoy playing with these children, even
if you could not talk with them. I know you would
like to fly big kites with the boys in Japan, or skate
down the canals with the little Dutch boys.</p>

<p>And as for dolls! I am sure there are as many dolls
in the world as there are little girls, and perhaps more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />13<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
because some little girls have so many dolls that
they cannot play with all of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/i-015.jpg" width="497" height="369" alt="Dutch boys skating" />
</div>

<p>You would like to play with the queer Chinese dolls
in their beautiful silken robes, or with the Eskimo
dolls that are carved out of bone and are dressed in
furs and sealskin.</p>

<p>The Indian girl has wooden dolls dressed in bright
blankets, with beads and feathers. The little French
girl has a big wax doll, with blue eyes that shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />14<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
when she lies down, and pop open when she sits up
again. She wears beautiful gowns and big hats with
feathers and ribbons.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be fun to have a dolls’ party to-day, if
the dolls from all over the world could come?</p>

<p>These dolls might be dressed in furs, or silks, or
blankets; they might be made of wax, or bone, or
wood. But if they could talk they would tell you
that the little girl who owns them loves them, and
that, whether she lives in a snow hut or a tent in the
desert, she has a loving father and mother and a
happy childhood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Are there many children in all the world?</p>

<p>What are some of them doing this very minute?</p>

<p>If you should go to school in Germany, what would
you have to do first?</p>

<p>What does a little German child have to do when
he first goes to school in our country?</p>

<p>Tell all the things you can that all the children in the
world do almost every day.</p>

<h2>THE SONG SPARROW’S WORK</h2>


<p>In the forest where the birds live there is always
work to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i-017.jpg" width="495" height="368" alt="owl in tree with full moon behind " />
</div>

<p>The woodpecker is a carpenter. He climbs up and
down the trees and chops a hole in the trunk of one
of them to make his home.</p>

<p>The crow flies down to the ground, and walks about
in the fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />16<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>He is the birds’ farmer. Toward evening, when
he cries, “Caw! Caw!” he means that the earth
needs rain.</p>

<p>The owl is the night policeman. He watches the
rats and mice, and keeps them out of the farmer’s
fields.</p>

<p>The kingbirds are the soldiers. They fight the
birds that come over from the next forest, and drive
them away.</p>

<p>The hawks have sharp eyes, and can see a long way.
They are the scouts, and tell the soldiers when the
enemy is coming.</p>

<p>The whip-poor-wills can see in the night, so they are
the birds’ night watchmen.</p>

<p>The orioles are weavers. They weave their nests,
and hang them in the tallest trees.</p>

<p>One of the birds is a thief, and steals eggs from the
nests of the other birds, but I shall not tell you <i>his</i>
name.</p>

<p>So all of the birds have work to do in the
forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />17<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>What do the song birds do? Ah! they have their
work, too. They sing cheerfully while the other birds
work, and make the hours short and the day
happy.</p>

<p>They sing of the goodness of God, and of the beauty
in the forest and sky.</p>

<p>If there were no song birds, the workers
might forget all of these lovely things. Then their
hearts would be as hard as the tree the woodpecker
is chopping.</p>

<p>One spring morning the song birds were singing so
beautifully that every one listened.</p>

<p>The woodpeckers cried, “Plitt! plitt!” The
crows screamed, “Rah! rah!” and the blackbirds
laughed with glee. This meant that they liked the
songs.</p>

<p>In the nests were many baby birds. They liked to
hear the songs, too, so they stretched up their little
heads.</p>

<p>But <i>they</i> could not understand the songs about the
sky and the forest. You see, they had not seen these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />18<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
things yet, and they did not know what the songs
meant.</p>

<p>The poor babies drooped their heads and were
very sad.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">
<img src="images/i-020.jpg" width="494" height="362" alt="bird on branch" />
</div>

<p>There was one bird who thought of the babies
in the nests, for he had a kind heart, and loved little
things.</p>

<p>“I will fly down and sing for them,” he thought;
“perhaps it will make them happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />19<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>So he flew into a little bush, quite near the ground,
and sang the sweetest song he knew. Over and over
again he sang it, and the babies in the nests listened
all the time.</p>

<p>“He is singing about the warm sunshine,” said
the baby robins.</p>

<p>“He is singing about rocking in this beautiful
cradle,” said the baby orioles.</p>

<p>Then, as the song grew sweeter and sweeter, “Listen,
listen!” they cried. “Now he is singing about our
mother. That is the best song of all.”</p>

<p>So the song sparrow sang in the little bush, telling
the babies about the sun and the breezes and their
mothers’ love.</p>

<p>He waked them in the morning; he sang them to
sleep at night.</p>

<p>Have you never heard him singing, “Sweet, sweet,
sweet, loving little mother, sweet”?</p>

<h2>DUTCH CHILDREN</h2>


<p>How would you like to go to Holland with me to
visit the little Dutch children?</p>

<p>First we must go to New York City in a railroad
train and then get on board of one of the big ships
that cross the ocean.</p>

<p>We shall have to travel over the water five or
six days and nights in this big ship, and then ride a
long way, after we come to land.</p>

<p>When the Pilgrims came to this country, nearly
three hundred years ago, they crossed the same ocean,
but it took them many weeks. They were in a small
sailing vessel, and had to come very slowly.</p>

<p>On board of this big ship you will find a great many
things to do and see. There are several hundred
people on the vessel, and it is interesting to watch
them. There are books to read, and games to play,
and the days will go very swiftly.</p>

<p>Most of the time you will not be able to see land
in any direction. All you can see is the sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />21<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
the sky and the ocean with big waves rolling and
tossing about.</p>

<p>I wonder what you will notice the very first thing
when you reach Holland.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="495" height="365" alt="two girls knitting" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps you will see a group of children running
down the street with their wooden shoes clacking on
the stone walks.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you will see some girls standing at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />22<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
corner knitting stockings, or a boy driving a dog
harnessed to a little cart.</p>

<p>If you take a train and ride through the country
you will see many strange things.</p>

<p>There are big windmills everywhere, with long
arms, and sails to catch the wind. These mills turn
wheels to pump water and grind corn and saw wood.
In Holland there are no rivers with falls and swift
currents to turn the mill wheels.</p>

<p>In some towns there are canals instead of streets,
with bridges for the people to cross from one side to
the other.</p>

<p>In summer there are many boats going up and
down the canals, but in winter the water in the
canals freezes, and then everybody skates. Think
what fun it must be to skate to church, to skate to
market, to skate to school, and then skate home
again!</p>

<p>A great many of the poor children in Holland wear
wooden shoes when they are out of doors. When
they go into the house they take off their shoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />23<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
leave them at the door. You can tell, by counting
the pairs of shoes at the door, how many children
there are in the house.</p>

<p>Every week the children scrub their wooden shoes
with soap and water until they are almost as white
as snow; then they dry them in the sun, or before the
fire in the big open fireplace.</p>

<p>These wooden shoes make fine boats, and sometimes
the boys take them off and sail them in the
canals. The little girls use them for doll carriages,
or play they are beds, and tuck their dolls into them
for a nap.</p>

<p>If you were walking down a village street in Holland
you might see a red silk ball, or a pink silk one,
hanging at the front door of one of the houses. This
is to show that there is a little new baby in the house.
If the ball is red, the baby is a boy; if it is pink, the
baby is a girl.</p>

<p>There are very good schools in Holland, and all
the children go to school and learn to read and write
and sing, just as you do. But their reading and singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />24<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
would sound very strange to you, and you could not
read one word of their writing.</p>

<p>The Dutch children have vacations and holidays,
of course. The holiday they like best of all is Santa
Claus Day. It comes on the sixth day of December,
and is very much like our Christmas Day.</p>

<p>The boys and girls put their wooden shoes in front
of the fireplace, on the hearth, just as you hang your
stocking near the chimney, and Santa Claus rides
over the roofs of the houses on a big horse and
drops presents down the chimney into the little
shoes.</p>

<p>How would you go from your home to New York
City? How long would it take?</p>

<p>What would you like to see in Holland?</p>

<p>What would you see that you never saw before?</p>

<p>Why do the people in Holland build windmills?</p>

<p>What kind of shoes do many of the children wear?</p>

Holland? Why?</p>

<h2>THE GREAT FEAST</h2>


<p>Once the Play Angel came into a nursery where
four little children sat on the floor with sad and troubled
faces.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, children?” asked the Play
Angel.</p>

<p>“We wanted to have a great feast,” said the child
whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be delightful,” said the Play
Angel.</p>

<p>“But there is only one cooky!” said the child
whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>“And it is a very small cooky!” said his little
cousin.</p>

<p>“Not big enough for me!” said the child whose
nursery it was.</p>

<p>The other two children said nothing, but they
looked at the cooky with big round eyes, and their
mouths went up in the middle and down at the
sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />27<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said the Play Angel, “let us have the
feast just the same. I think we can manage it.”</p>

<p>She broke the cooky into four pieces, and gave one
piece to the littlest child.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/i-029.jpg" width="493" height="362" alt="Angel on floor with children" />
</div>

<p>“See,” she said. “This is a roast chicken. It is
just as brown and crisp as it can be. There is cranberry
sauce on one side, and on the other a little
mountain of mashed potato. It must be a volcano,
it smokes so. Do you see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />28<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the littlest child, and his mouth went
down in the middle and up at the corners.</p>

<p>The Play Angel gave a piece to the next
child.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said, “is a little pie. Outside, as you
see, it is brown and crusty, and inside it is all chicken,
and ham, and jelly, and hard-boiled eggs. Did you
ever see such a pie?”</p>

<p>“No, I never did,” said the child.</p>

<p>“Now here,” said the Angel to the third child,
“is a round cake. The frosting is half an inch thick,
and inside there are chopped nuts and raisins. It is
the prettiest cake I ever saw, and the best.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said the third child.</p>

<p>Then the Angel gave the last piece to the child
whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said, “just look! Here is an ice-cream
rabbit. He is snowy white outside, with eyes
of red sugar; see his long ears, and his little tail.
Inside, I think you will find he is pink.</p>

<p>“Now, when I clap my hands and count one, two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />29<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
three, you must eat the feast all up. One—two,—three!”</p>

<p>So the children ate the feast all up.</p>

<p>“There,” said the Angel, “did you ever see such
a grand feast?”</p>

<p>“No, we never did!” said all the four children
together.</p>

<p>“And there are some crumbs left over,” said the
Angel. “Come, and we will give them to the brother
birds.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t have any,” said the child whose
nursery it was.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said the Angel, “I had it all.”</p>

<h2>LITTLE GRANDMOTHER’S SHOES</h2>


<p>“But, Grandmother,” said little May, holding up
the tiny pair of calf-skin shoes, “were these your
very <i>best</i> shoes? Didn’t you have any shiny black ones,
with a tassel on, like mine?</p>

hundred years before these shoes were made.</p>

<p>“Bring your chair and sit down by me. I will tell
you all about these little worn-out shoes of mine.</p>

<p>“When I was a little girl,” began Grandmother,
“children did not wear shoes all the time. They
went barefoot in the summer, except when they were
dressed up. One pair of shoes had to last a whole
year.</p>

<p>“When we went to church we used to go barefoot,
carrying our shoes in our hands. At the foot of the
hill we washed our feet in the brook and put on our
shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>“Our shoes did not wear out very fast; and if we
lost a shoe, we had to go barefoot till the shoemaker
came again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed May, “how dreadful! Who
was the shoemaker, Grandmother, and when did he
come?”</p>

<p>“The shoemaker,” Grandmother replied, “was a
very important man when I was a little girl. ‘Shoe
week’ was a busy week in the family.</p>

<p>“I can remember how glad we all were when father
said, ‘The shoemaker will be here to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“That night the shoe bench was brought down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />32<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
the attic and placed in a warm corner of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Father and mother made a list of the shoes that
were needed. We children talked about our new
shoes and the shoemaker until we fell asleep.</p>

<p>“Early in the morning the shoemaker appeared.
He carried his bag of tools and a roll of leather on
his back. By seven o’clock he was seated at his bench,
hard at work.</p>

<p>“We children used to sit on the floor beside him and
watch him work. First he measured our feet and drew
some paper patterns. Then he cut out the leather.</p>

<p>“He punched holes along the edges of the leather
with a sharp awl; then the shoe was ready to sew.</p>

<p>“For his sewing he used a long waxed thread,
with a stiff bristle at each end for a needle. All day
long he would sit at his bench, putting the needles
into the holes and pulling the thread through, till the
shoe was sewed firmly.</p>

<p>“When all our shoes were made, he packed his
bag and said good-by for another year.”</p>

<h2>CHILDREN OF A SUNNY LAND</h2>


<h3>I—A STRANGE MILK WAGON</h3>

<p>Domingo and his sister Marikena live in a warm,
sunny land. It is the land of Brazil, where there are
fruits and flowers all the year, and it is always summer.</p>

<p>Domingo and Marikena love the sunshine, and the
birds and flowers.</p>

<p>They like to play out of doors in the early morning
and at night, but at noon it is too hot, and every one
takes a nap.</p>

<p>When they go to the woods they do not see crows
and blue jays and woodpeckers. Instead, there are
gorgeous parrots and beautiful humming-birds that
are almost as large as robins.</p>

<p>Perhaps they see monkeys in the palm trees; and,
instead of acorns, they find cocoanuts.</p>

<p>In their schoolroom they sing all their lessons. Is
not that a merry way? But it would seem strange to
you because you could not understand one word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />36<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
they say. You see, they do not speak English, and
they could not talk with you.</p>

<p>Every morning the two children are up very early
and out on the balcony watching for something. Soon
they call out, “<i>leite, leite</i>,” which means, “milk,
milk.”</p>

<p>And what do you suppose they see? Not a wagon
filled with glass jars or tin cans. Oh, no! It is only
two or three cows being driven down the street by a
woman.</p>

<p>The woman stops the cows in front of Domingo’s
house, and milks one of them while the children watch
her. How sweet and fresh this milk is! I wish you
could have some every morning, too!</p>


<h3>II—A RIDE IN A CHAIR</h3>

<p>Domingo and Marikena are going with their mother
to visit their cousin.</p>

<p>They have had their afternoon nap and it is not
too hot out of doors now, as it is nearly four o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />37<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>If you were going to pay a visit you would walk
or ride in a car or carriage, would you not?</p>

<p>But Domingo and Marikena are not going in either
of those ways. It is too hot to walk, and the streetcars
do not go up the hill where their aunt lives, so
they will ride in a chair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i-039.jpg" width="491" height="351" alt="Children carrying a litter" />
</div>

<p>The chairs are large and have big, soft cushions.
They have a cover overhead and curtains on all sides,
and are carried by four men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />38<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The two children ride in one chair; their mother in
another. The curtains are drawn down, but Domingo
peeps out as they ride through the city streets.</p>

<p>When they reach the cousin’s house they do not
rap on the door or ring a bell. The mother claps her
hands, and when the aunt sees them she says, “Enter
and welcome. The house and all it contains is yours.”</p>

<p>Is not that a strange way of saying, “I am glad to
see you. Will you come in?”</p>

<p>They sit in the parlor and while they talk they sip
coffee from tiny cups. Before they come away they
walk in the garden, where there are beautiful flowers
and fountains, tall palm trees, and rubber trees with
blossoms like yellow lilies.</p>

<p>The chair-men wait and the children ride home again,
but it is dark, and they can see only the lights in
the houses. The chair swings back and forth like a
cradle as the men trot down the hill into the city.</p>

<p>They sing as they go, and the song is a low, sweet
tune like a lullaby. Marikena puts her head on the
cushions and almost falls asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />39<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Domingo nods and dreams of the fruit and the
flowers and the funny pet monkey his cousin had in
the garden. Oh! the days are long and happy in
Brazil, and the children have merry times.</p>


<h3>III—THE CARNIVAL</h3>

<p>“The Carnival, the Carnival,” shouted Domingo
one morning. “This is the first day of the Carnival.”</p>

<p>Then he ran to find Marikena. “Look, Sister,”
he cried, “I am a clown this year. What are you?”</p>

<p>“I am a fairy,” she replied. “See my cap and
wand. And here is a bag full of sugarplums and
sweetmeats. I can hang the bag over my shoulder.”</p>

<p>“See these big pockets,” said her brother. “They
are bigger than a bag and they are just full of goodies.
I like to be a clown, because I can have such big
pockets. Take that!” and he threw a handful of
sugarplums into her lap.</p>

<p>Just then there was a clapping of hands at the
door and the children ran to the balcony.</p>

<p>In Brazil the Carnival is held on the three days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />40<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
before Lent, and every one has a holiday. The cities
are beautifully decorated, and men, women and
children wear odd costumes and masks.</p>

<p>Some of them are dressed to look like monkeys,
some like parrots, and some like clowns. Some wear
gay dresses and funny masks, and others wear ugly
skins of animals and hideous masks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">
<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="492" height="362" alt="dressed as a clown and a pixie" />
</div>

<p>The children often carry wreaths and garlands of
flowers; and there is always music and feasting and
dancing in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />41<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Every one has pockets, bags, or baskets full of
sugarplums, sweetmeats, bonbons and flowers.</p>

<p>These they throw at every one they meet, laughing
merrily if they make a good hit.</p>

<p>The children think it is great fun to pelt each other
with sugarplums and flowers. It is as good as snow-balling,
only they can never have snow battles because
they never have any snow.</p>

<p>The Carnival is the best time of all the year in Brazil,
or at least Domingo and Marikena think so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where do Domingo and Marikena live?</p>

<p>When do they play out of doors?</p>

<p>What do they see in the woods?</p>

<p>How is the milk brought to their house?</p>

<p>When they go visiting, what do they ride in?</p>

<p>What did their aunt say when they went to call on
her? What did they do at their aunt’s house?</p>

<p>What do some of the people wear on Carnival days?</p>

<p>What do they carry in their pockets? What do they
throw at each other?</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE PLANT</h2>


<p>On the edge of the forest stood a tiny plant. It was
only six inches tall.</p>

<p>The ground around it was so cold and hard that it
could not grow taller. It had stood there many
years, sad and sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Grow and be beautiful,” said the forest sternly,
but the plant did not grow.</p>

<p>“Do you not wish to grow?” said the blue jay.
Then he began to tell the little plant how lazy and
useless it was. But his words went into one ear and
out of the other.</p>

<p>Still the plant did not grow.</p>

<p>“Grow! grow!” roared the wind. “Grow tall
and straight. I will teach you to obey. Grow!
grow!”</p>

<p>Then the wind lashed the tiny plant with its cold
wings, and beat its branches to the ground. But the
poor thing came near dying and did not grow at
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />43<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Do grow,” said the sun. “Grow and be beautiful.
I will help you.”</p>

<p>Then the sun warmed the earth around the plant,
and gentle showers fell on it from the clouds.</p>

<p>Now the little twigs began to grow, and the tiny
plant became a beautiful birch tree, with green leaves
and snow-white bark.</p>

<h2>TWO WAYS</h2>


<p>Two little weeds grew on a bank by the roadside.</p>

<p>All summer they had been drinking the dew and
sunshine, and had been very happy.</p>

<p>But now autumn had come, with gray skies and
winds that nipped and pinched them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-046.jpg" width="500" height="248" alt="girl looking at weed" />
</div>

<p>“We shall die soon,” said one little weed.</p>

<p>“I should like to do something pleasant before I
die, just to show what a happy time I have had. I
think I will turn red, and then people will see how I
feel.”</p>

<p>“You will be very foolish to waste your strength
in any such nonsense!” said the other little weed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />45<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
“I shall live as long as I can, and hug the brown
bank here.”</p>

<p>So the first little weed turned bright scarlet, and
was so pretty that every one looked at it.</p>

<p>By and by there came down the road a most beautiful
maiden.</p>

<p>When she saw the scarlet leaves she picked them
and put them in her hair.</p>

<p>This made the little weed so happy that he died
for pure joy.</p>

<p>The second little weed lived on, and turned slowly
brown, like the bank.</p>

<p>“He was so foolish!” he said, speaking of the
weed that turned scarlet. “He put all his strength
into turning red, and so he died.”</p>

<p>“I was proud of him,” said the brown bank. “He
did what he could, and people loved him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I am alive, and stay with you!” said the
weed.</p>

<p>“Much I care!” said the bank.</p>

<h2>HOW THE CORN GREW</h2>


<p>Little Me Too walked to the right, then to the
left, along the sidewalk in front of the house.</p>

<p>As he walked he sang with all his might about the
ocean, and the summer time, and any other pleasant
thing that came into his head.</p>

<p>He made it up as he went along, and grew quite
out of breath at last, and had to stop.</p>

<p>Just as he had got his breath and was meaning to
begin all over again, he saw something very small
and yellow on the edge of the walk.</p>

<p>Then he began to sing the song of whatever it might
be that was so small and yellow.</p>

<p>This is what he sang:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I wonder what this is.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I guess it is a kernel of corn.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wonder how it came here</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All alone by itself.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />48<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I guess I don’t know.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wonder if it can be planted</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the grass in our yard.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yes!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When he said “Yes!” he stooped down and dug a
hole in the ground in the dooryard with his
fingers.</p>

<p>Then he put the kernel of corn in the hole and
covered it over with dirt.</p>

<p>Afterwards he stood up and sang at the top of
his voice, “Now I guess it will grow!”</p>

<p>Of course it grew!</p>

<p>After a few days it poked itself up through the earth
to make Little Me Too remember. For Little Me Too
had forgotten all about it.</p>

<p>When he saw it poking its head up through the
grass, he didn’t remember even then that it was the
kernel of corn.</p>

<p>It had changed.</p>

<p>When he put it into the ground and covered it with
dirt, it was yellow and hard.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />49<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Now it was green and soft. It looked somewhat
like the rest of the grass,—but not <i>just</i> like it, or
Little Me Too wouldn’t have noticed it.</p>

<img src="images/i-051.jpg" width="488" height="358" alt="Boy talking to man mowing grass" />
</div>

<p>When he saw it he said, “There’s a grass that wants
to be different. Perhaps it’s the grandfather grass.”</p>

<p>He let it alone, and he got the man with the lawn
mower to let it alone. That gave it a good chance
to grow.</p>

<p>It grew just as fast as it could, and as soon as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />50<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
was big enough it showed Little Me Too that it was no
grandfather grass, but a cornstalk.</p>

<p>The man with the lawn mower said so.</p>

<p>Then it was that Little Me Too remembered. When
he remembered, he said, “Yes, it grew.”</p>

<p>When it had grown to be taller than Little Me Too,
people walking along the sidewalk would look at it,
and say, “What a fine garden!”</p>

<p>The mother said, “I am glad it is something that
can’t find its way into the nursery.”</p>

<p>Little Me Too it was who first saw the ear of corn
growing on the stalk.</p>

<p>He showed it to some people, and there were others
who saw it without having it shown to them.</p>

<p>Each of them asked for a bite from it when it should
be ripe.</p>

<p>Little Me Too said “yes,” to them all.</p>

<p>When he had said “yes” to thirty-one people, his
mother said, “Don’t say ‘yes’ to any more people;
you won’t have corn enough for them all.”</p>

<p>Little Me Too promised not to say “yes” again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />51<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
but sometimes he forgot, and by the time the corn
was ripe he had said “yes” to fifty people.</p>

<p>But he had plenty of corn, for it was an ear of pop
corn.</p>

<p>After it was popped over the nursery fire it filled
a big, big bowl.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE GOATHERDS</h2>


<p>Louis and Marie live among the mountains in
Switzerland. These mountains are very high and are
called the Swiss Alps.</p>

<p>The cold winds sweep down the mountain-side and
rush through the valleys. Sometimes it blows so
hard that it almost blows the thatched roofs off the
houses.</p>

<p>But the mountain people know all about these
strong winds. What do you suppose they do to keep
the roof from blowing away? They lay heavy stones
on the roof to keep it in place.</p>

<p>The winters are long and cold; and it snows and
snows! You never saw such deep drifts nor such
big fields of ice.</p>

<p>But the summer is beautiful,—the sky is blue
and the sun is bright; and far away the mountain
peaks are capped with glistening snow.</p>

<p>Then the grass is green and the flowers blossom
everywhere. These are happy days for the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />53<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>In summer Louis and Marie go out every morning
with the goats. Marie is just a tiny bit of a girl only
four years old, but Louis is a big boy. He is
almost nine, and that is very old when one has such
a little sister.</p>

<p>Louis lets the goats out of their yard. They jump
and run and caper about, and Marie hides behind her
mother’s dress. She is afraid of the goats at first.</p>

<p>One of the big goats always runs to the vineyard,
he is so fond of grapes. Louis drives him out with
a long stick.</p>

<p>Then the whole herd runs to the wheat field,
and Louis runs after them, shouting at them and
driving them away toward the mountain pasture.</p>

<p>Marie runs along with him and Patte Blanche
goes, too. Patte Blanche is their dog, and his name
means White Foot.</p>

<p>When the goats reach the pasture land they clamber
over the rocks and eat the moss and the bushes and
the sweet, green grass.</p>

<p>Louis and Marie pick the flowers that grow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />54<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
mountain-side, and play little games with the stones.
They watch the goats, too, and talk about them.
Sometimes a goat wanders too far away and then
Louis sends White Foot to drive her back to the others.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/i-056.jpg" width="486" height="355" alt="woman and girl watching goats run past" />
</div>

<p>At noon the children eat their lunch of barley-bread
and cheese, and White Foot sits beside them
and eats the bits they give him.</p>

<p>There is always so much to do and so much to see
that the days seem very short. Soon it is time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />55<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
White Foot to drive the goats down from the rocks
and the little company starts for home.</p>

<p>One night a very funny thing happened when they
were on their way home.</p>

<p>The goats were wandering along, nibbling at the
green grass, and the children were following them
down the path, when they saw a strange man sitting
on a log. The man was fast asleep and his head
nodded and bobbed up and down.</p>

<p>Just as Louis saw him, one of the goats spied him,
too, and what do you think she did? She trotted
along, ran up behind him and butted him right off the
log. Of course the man waked up and I think he was
going to be very angry, but the goat put her fore feet
up on the log and looked as if she wanted to laugh.</p>

<p>The children laughed, and so the man laughed, too.
Then he walked home with them and helped them
drive the goats into their yard.</p>

<p>Louis and Marie will never forget how funny the goat
looked trying to laugh at the man, and they like to
tell the story over and over again.</p>

<h2>SWISS CHILDREN</h2>


<p>You have just read a story about Louis and Marie,
who live among the mountains of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Switzerland is a land of mountains and valleys
and many beautiful lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>Most of the people live in the valleys and keep
cattle, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p>In the springtime thousands of cattle are driven
up into the mountains to stay all summer.</p>

<p>Many of the people go up into the mountains, too,
and live in little huts. The men and boys take care
of the cattle, and the women make butter and cheese.</p>

<p>The cows wear bells which tinkle as they walk,
and the music of all the bells, in the stillness of the
mountains, is very beautiful.</p>

<p>In the fall the men drive the cattle down into the
valleys again. When they reach the villages their
friends come out to meet them, and every one has a
holiday. The children think this is one of the best
days in all the year. They like to hear the bells ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />57<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
out their welcome; they like to see the flags and
banners waving from the windows and the house-tops.
They sing and dance and shout and are very
merry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i-059.jpg" width="496" height="365" alt="boy and dog" />
</div>

<p>At night there is a feast in the village square, and
perhaps they like this best of all.</p>

<p>Many of the houses in Switzerland are very small
and are made of wood. These little houses are called
chalets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />58<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Louis and Marie live in a tiny chalet on the side
of a steep mountain. Their father owns a farm and
has cows and sheep and goats, and ever so many
geese.</p>

<p>You never saw such a farm in all your life. The
mountain is so steep that the fields and pastures
seem to be tipped up on edge, and it looks as if
the horses would fall off when the farmer is plowing
the fields, but they never do.</p>

<p>Louis has a pet dog. He harnesses his dog to a
little wagon and drives him up and down the road.
Sometimes he gives Marie a ride in the wagon.</p>

<p>Louis goes to the village school, and Marie will have
to go as soon as she is six years old. There are very
good schools in Switzerland, and the children learn
the same things that you learn in your school.</p>

<p>These children have many odd playthings and
toys carved out of wood. They have wooden whistles
and horns, and little wooden goats and bears. Marie
has a tiny chalet, almost like the one she lives in, which
she calls her “playhouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />59<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The toys the children like best are the ones that have
a music box in them. The Swiss people make all kinds
of music boxes and put them in all kinds of things,
in chairs and tables and clocks, and even in plates.</p>

<p>While the boys are learning to carve, the girls
learn to embroider on linen and to make lace.</p>

<p>Very often the Swiss girls sit outside the door of
their chalet making lace which they sell to the people
who are travelling through the mountains.</p>

<h2>THE STONE BLOCKS</h2>


<p>“Why is your little sister crying, dear?” asked
the Play Angel. “I thought you were taking care of
her.”</p>

<img src="images/i-063.jpg" width="490" height="236" alt="little ister crying on floor wihile big sister holds up doll to her" />
</div>

<p>“So I am, taking beautiful care of her,” said the
child. “But the more beautiful care I take, the more
she cries. She does not like to have me take care of
her.”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said the Play Angel, and she sat
down on the nursery floor. “Now show me what you
have been doing.”</p>

<p>“Look,” said the child. “First I showed her all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />62<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
my dolls, and then all my dolls’ dresses. Now I have
given her my new stone blocks to play with, but she
will not play with them. She puts them in her mouth
and cries.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is hungry!” said the Play Angel.</p>

<p>So she took a piece of bread and gave it to the
baby. The baby stopped crying and ate the bread,
and laughed and crowed.</p>

<p>“See!” said the Angel. “Now she is happy.
Remember, dear, that when babies are hungry, stone
blocks do them no good.”</p>

<p>“You are a very clever angel to know that,” said
the child.</p>

<p>“You are a rather foolish child,” said the Angel,
“or you would have found it out for yourself.”</p>

<h2>GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMA’S CHRISTMAS IN
ENGLAND</h2>


<p>Betty and Percy sat up until eleven o’clock that
Christmas Eve. It was such a merry time!</p>

<p>They saw the men bring in the Yule log. It was
so big that it took three men to carry it, and then they
had to bring it in on their shoulders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i-065.jpg" width="489" height="358" alt="three men carrying log" />
</div>

<p>At one end of the hall was a large fireplace. I think
you never saw one like it. Pots and kettles hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />64<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
over the fire, and on each side were seats where the
children could sit and eat apples and tell stories. You
see, it was a very big fireplace.</p>

<p>The men rolled the Yule log into the fireplace and
lighted the fire. How the sparks flew! How the
fire roared up the chimney!</p>

<p>It lighted the great hall. It shone on the oak table
where the supper was laid.</p>

<p>On the supper table were two wax candles. These
candles were almost as tall as you are. They were
wreathed with holly.</p>

<p>These were the Christmas candles and they burned
the whole evening. The hall was trimmed with holly
and mistletoe. The holly had bright green leaves and
red berries, and the mistletoe had white berries.</p>

<p>A big bunch of mistletoe hung down from the
ceiling before the fire. If anyone happened to stand
under the mistletoe, she was kissed.</p>

<p>How many times Betty was kissed! First her father
caught her under the mistletoe, then Uncle Edward,
and then Grandpa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />65<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>At eleven o’clock Nurse said that Betty and Percy
must go to bed. They did not like to go one bit.</p>

<p>There was a fire in the fireplace in Betty’s bedroom,
but it was very cold. In Great-Great-Grandma’s
time there were no such things as stoves and furnaces.</p>

<p>Nurse undressed Betty, and then the little girl
climbed up the steps into her bed. It was so big
and high that she had to climb up five steps to get
into it.</p>

<p>Then Nurse drew the curtains of the bed to keep
out the cold.</p>

<p>Betty was almost asleep when she heard the Waits
singing. The Waits always sang under the windows
on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>“Open the lattice, please, Nurse,” she said.</p>

<p>So Nurse opened one of the windows. It opened
like a door, and had panes of glass which were small
and diamond-shaped.</p>

<p>The house Betty lived in was very, very large, and
was called a castle.</p>

<p>This is what the Waits were singing:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />66<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was born upon this day.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Betty did not hear the next verse, because her eyes
were shut and she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>When she waked up in the morning, the first thing
she heard was another Christmas carol.</p>

<p>She slid down the side of the bed and ran to the
window.</p>

<p>It was a lovely Christmas morning. The trees and
ground and walks were covered with snow. How it
glistened in the sunshine!</p>

<p>The singers were standing in a row under the window.
There were seven of them, and they were all
children from the village whom Betty had seen when
she was driving with her mother.</p>

<p>How they were bundled up, and their cheeks were
as red as roses!</p>

<p>They were singing this Christmas carol:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />67<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On Christmas Day in the morning.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Quick, quick, Nurse,” said Betty. “Please dress
me as quickly as you can. I must run down with the
Christmas boxes.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/i-069.jpg" width="509" height="687" alt="Little girl being dressed by nurse" />
<div class="caption">PLEASE DRESS ME AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.</div>
</div>

<p>So Nurse hurried, and Betty hurried, and in a little
while she was ready, with a sprig of holly in her dress,
and a bit of mistletoe in her hair.</p>

<p>Percy was ready, too, and they ran down the long
staircase into the wide hall.</p>

<p>The Yule log was still burning,—it had burned
all night. The door was opened, and the little singers
came in to warm themselves by the fire.</p>

<p>Betty and Percy gave each of them a “Christmas
box.” It wasn’t a box, it was a gift; but a Christmas
gift was called a Christmas box in those days.</p>

<p>After the singers had looked at their gifts and had
eaten a slice of plum cake, they went home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />68<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>I cannot tell you everything that Betty and Percy did
that day, but you may be sure they had a good time.</p>

<p>I must tell you about the Christmas dinner. It
was served in the hall, on the big oak table that stood
before the fire.</p>

<p>When dinner was ready they did not ring a bell,
but the cook knocked three times with his rolling-pin
on the door.</p>

<p>Two men stood in the hall, and when they heard
the three knocks they sounded their trumpets, the
doors were opened, and all the family marched in to
dinner.</p>

<p>I do not know just what they had to eat, but I
know they had roast goose, and a plum pudding just
as you do at Christmas time.</p>

<p>After dinner the children played games. And what
do you think they played? First they played “Puss-puss-in-the-corner,”
and then “Blind-man’s-buff.”</p>

<p>Isn’t it strange that Great-Great-Grandma should
have played the very games you play, on that Christmas
night more than two hundred years ago?</p>

<h2>THE WHIPPING BOY</h2>


<p>Many years ago there was a little boy living in
England whose name was Edward. Of course there
have been many boys in England by the name of
Edward, but they are not so well known as this boy,
for he was the son of a king.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i-073.jpg" width="490" height="247" alt="two boys, wearing plumed hats, walking in country side" />
</div>

<p>Edward’s father was King Henry the Eighth, and
Edward was called Edward the Sixth when he became
King of England.</p>

<p>King Henry was very fond of his children and did
not like to have them punished, so he had a little
“whipping boy” for each one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />70<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Whenever one of the Princes or Princesses did
anything naughty, the whipping boy was punished.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had to stand in the corner for a whole
hour. Sometimes he was sent to bed without any
supper, and sometimes he had to have a whipping.</p>

<p>Prince Edward’s whipping boy was Edward Brown.
He lived in the castle and played with the Prince every
day. The two boys were very fond of each other,
and the Prince did not like to have his friend punished.</p>

<p>So he tried to be good, but there are so many things
a Prince must not do!</p>

<p>A Prince must not throw his toys out of the castle
window. He must never get angry at his brothers
and sisters and quarrel with them. He must learn
his lessons every day.</p>

<p>He must be polite and obedient to the King and
Queen, to all the Gentlemen in Waiting and Ladies
in Waiting, to the Head Nurse and all the Under
Nurses, and to his Tutor and all his teachers.</p>

<p>Oh! it is very hard to be a good Prince!</p>

<p>Sometimes Edward Brown had to be punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />71<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
more than once while the boys were at play, and
sometimes Prince Edward was quite good all day
long.</p>

<p>One day the Prince did something that was very
wrong; and when his Tutor would have punished the
whipping boy, Edward took the cane from his hand
and said, “Sir, you shall whip me for this. It is my
command. I did wrong. I should be punished.”</p>

<p>When Prince Edward was nine years old, his father
died, and the Prince was made King of England.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know how he was dressed
when he went to be crowned. He wore a suit of white
velvet, embroidered with diamonds, pearls, and rubies.
His cap was white velvet, and his coat was cloth of
silver.</p>

<p>He rode on a white horse through the city and the
people shouted, “Long live King Edward.”</p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS SPRUCE TREE</h2>


<p>Among the tall trees in the forest grew a little
spruce tree. It was no taller than a man, and that
is very short for a tree.</p>

<p>The other trees near it grew so tall and had such
large branches that the poor little tree could not
grow at all.</p>

<p>She liked to listen when the other trees were talking,
but it often made her sad.</p>

<p>“I am king of the forest,” said the oak. “Look
at my huge trunk and my branches. How they reach
up toward heaven! I furnish planks for men from
which they build their ships. Then I defy the storm
on the ocean as I did the thunder in the forest.”</p>

<p>“And I go with you over the foaming waves,”
said the tall straight pine. “I hold up the flapping
sails when the ships fly over the ocean.”</p>

<p>“And we warm the houses when winter comes
and the cold north wind drives the snow before him,”
said the birches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />73<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“We have the same work to do,” said a tall fir
tree, and she bowed gracefully, drooping her branches
toward the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 496px;">
<img src="images/i-077.jpg" width="496" height="368" alt="mother and children around the Christmas tree" />
</div>

<p>The little spruce tree heard the other trees talking
about their work in the world. This made her sad,
and she thought, “What work can I do? What
will become of me?”</p>

<p>But she could not think of any way in which she
could be useful. She decided to ask the other trees
in the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />74<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>So she asked the oak, the pine and the fir, but they
were so proud and stately they did not even hear her.</p>

<p>Then she asked the beautiful white birch that stood
near by. “You have no work to do,” said the birch,
“because you can never grow large enough. Perhaps
you might be a Christmas tree, but that is all.”</p>

<p>“What is a Christmas tree?” asked the little
spruce.</p>

<p>“I do not know exactly,” replied the birch. “Sometimes
when the days are short and cold, and the ground
is covered with snow, men come out here into the
forest. They look at all the little spruce trees and
choose the prettiest, saying, ‘This will do for a
Christmas tree.’</p>

<p>“Then they chop it down and carry it away. What
they do with it I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>The little spruce asked the rabbit that hopped over
the snow, the owls that slept in the pines, and the
squirrels that came to find nuts and acorns.</p>

<p>But no one knew more than the birch tree. No
one could tell what men did with the Christmas trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />75<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Then the little spruce tree wept because she had no
work to do and could not be of any use in the
world.</p>

<p>The tears hardened into clear, round drops, which
we call gum.</p>

<p>At last a boy came into the forest with an axe in
his hand. He looked the little tree all over. “Perhaps
this will do for a Christmas tree,” he said. So he
chopped it down, laid it on a sled, and dragged it
home.</p>

<p>The next day the boy sold the tree, and it was taken
into a large room and dressed up with pop corn and
gilded nuts and candles. Packages of all sizes and
shapes, and tiny bags filled with candy, were tied on
its branches.</p>

<p>The tree was trembling with the excitement, but
she stood as still as she could. “What if I should
drop some of this fruit,” she thought.</p>

<p>When it began to grow dark, every one left the
room and the tree was alone. It began to feel lonely
and to think sad thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />76<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Soon the door opened and a lady came in. She
lighted all the candles.</p>

<p>How light and glowing it was then!</p>

<p>The tree had never even dreamed of anything so
beautiful!</p>

<p>Then the children came and danced about the
tree, singing a Christmas song. The father played on
his violin, and the baby sat in her mother’s arms,
smiling and cooing.</p>

<p>“Now I know what I was made for,” thought the
spruce tree; “I was intended to give joy to the little
ones, because I, myself, am so small and humble.”</p>

<h2>THE EVE OF ST. NICHOLAS</h2>


<p>It was the Eve of St. Nicholas. In Germany St.
Nicholas’s Day comes on the sixth of December.</p>

<p>The children were in the nursery. On the hearth
before the fireplace, were five little sugar shoes.</p>

<p>Thekla was filling her shoe with oats. Max put
rye in his shoe. Hans put an apple in his, and Gretchen
filled hers with lumps of sugar.</p>

<p>Betty, the poor little girl who sometimes helped in
the kitchen, had only a bit of brown bread to put in
her shoe.</p>

<p>The children were expecting St. Nicholas, who
always comes on a white horse, and the things in the
shoes were for the horse to eat.</p>

<p>As the clock struck six there was a loud knock at
the door.</p>

<p>Aunt Hilda opened the door, and in came St.
Nicholas. He was very tall and had a long white
beard. He wore a long black robe and a red and white
cap, with a big red tassel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />78<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Dear little children,” he said, “it will soon be
Christmas. I have come to find the good children. I
shall bring gifts to them on Christmas Eve. Has
Thekla learned to knit?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">
<img src="images/i-082.jpg" width="494" height="364" alt="Santa Caus at the door" />
</div>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said her mother. “See this pair of
stockings she has knit for Hans.”</p>

<p>“They are very well made,” said St. Nicholas.
“I shall surely bring a gift for Thekla. Has Hans
learned to get up early?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />79<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“We have not had to call him for six weeks,” said
his father.</p>

<p>“Good,” said St. Nicholas. “Has Max learned his
multiplication tables?”</p>

<p>“Max is trying very hard,” said Aunt Hilda. “He
knows all but the nines and twelves.”</p>

<p>“And the dear little Gretchen?” said St. Nicholas,
patting the baby’s golden curls.</p>

<p>They all smiled, and the mother said, “The dear
little Gretchen is always sweet and good.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I shall certainly bring many beautiful
gifts to this house,” said St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>“And don’t forget little Betty,” said Aunt Hilda.</p>

<p>So the good Saint took the oats, the rye and the
apple, the lumps of sugar, and the bit of brown
bread out of the sugar shoes and went out into
the night. I suppose he gave them to his horse.</p>

<p>“St. Nicholas has eyes like Uncle Max,” said
Thekla.</p>

<p>“He smiled like Uncle Max, too,” said her
brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />80<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>St. Nicholas kept his word. On Christmas Eve
there was a Christmas tree in the parlor. On it there
were many beautiful gifts, and little Betty was not
forgotten.</p>

<p>The next night the children hung gifts on the same
tree for father, mother, Uncle Max, Aunt Hilda, and
the dear Grandfather.</p>

<p>Each one of the children had something of his very
own for Grandfather.</p>

<p>Thekla had knit a warm scarf for him. Max can
carve in wood, so he had made a stout cane and had
carved it very handsomely.</p>

<p>Hans drew a picture for him, and the dear little
Gretchen gave him two of her very best kisses.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a very happy Christmas!</p>

<h2>“THE LITTLE TURKEYS”</h2>

<h3>IN SCHOOL</h3>


<p>The “little Turkeys” that I am going to tell you
about are the children that live in a far away land
called Turkey.</p>

<p>To reach this land you would have to travel many
hundreds of miles in railroad trains and big ships.</p>

<p>In fact it is almost as far away as China, and that,
you know, is farther away than you can imagine.</p>

<p>The “little Turkeys” are very interesting, and
they would think your way of living just as strange as
you will think theirs is.</p>

<p>To begin at the very beginning, the tiny baby
doesn’t wear any dresses. He is wrapped round and
round, body, legs, and arms, with cloths, until he
looks like a dry-goods bundle.</p>

<p>Every baby wears a gay little bonnet, usually bright
green, because the favorite color of the Turks is green.</p>

<p>The Turkish baby is often hung up in a little cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />84<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
hammock, but sometimes he is rocked to sleep in a
wooden cradle.</p>

<p>The cradle is a long wooden box on low rockers
with high carved ends.</p>

<p>In the Sultan’s treasure house is a cradle of solid
gold, decorated with pearls, diamonds, and rubies.
This is the cradle in which the baby princes are rocked;
and it is very beautiful, as you can easily imagine.</p>

<p>When the boy baby is about a year old he is placed
in charge of a man nurse, if the father is not too poor.
This man takes care of him until he is six years old.</p>

<p>Then the boy is given a new suit of clothes and a
pony, and he is ready to go to school. Almost all of
the boys in Turkey ride on horse-back. I think you
would like that.</p>

<p>The new suit may be big baggy trousers, with an
embroidered shirt and short jacket. Or it may be
long full trousers of gay striped calico, and a little
jacket, quilted in puffy squares.</p>

<p>Every boy wears on his head a red fez with a black
tassel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />85<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>In his new suit, the boy starts off for school on his
pony, and his brothers go with him. The bells on the
pony jingle, the boys shout and sing, and it is a very
merry procession.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="490" height="365" alt="three boys, wearing fezes, sitting on mats reading" />
</div>

<p>The schoolhouse stands near the church. Inside,
it is very plain. There is a blackboard hung from
the ceiling, a shelf for books and slates, and one for a
water jar.</p>

<p>There is a little shelf for the teacher’s pipe, and a
place where he makes coffee over a tiny lamp. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />86<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
the teacher smokes and sips coffee while the children
study their lessons.</p>

<p>The children sit cross-legged on mats on the floor,
and study out loud, bending their bodies back and
forth all the time. Perhaps they think this helps them
to remember.</p>

<p>They learn their letters, and very queer letters
you would think them, out of the Koran. They have
no other book until they know this one by heart,
and can repeat it and write it.</p>

<p>Then they learn a little arithmetic and a very little
geography.</p>

<p>In olden times the girls did not go to school at all,
but stayed at home learning to keep house, sew, and
embroider. They were also taught to weave cloth and
to make beautiful rugs.</p>

<p>Now there are many schools for girls, as well as
high schools and colleges for both girls and boys.</p>

<p>The noise of the studying is stopped once during
the day. At noon the time for prayer is called out
from the tower of the church. Then all is quiet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />87<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
a few minutes while teacher and pupils kneel to say
the midday prayer.</p>

<p>Then the candy-man appears with all sorts of sweets
on trays. The candies are called “Turkish delights.”
They are “pasty, creamy, crackly things, made from
rose-leaves, violets, nuts, dates and grapes, mixed
with honey, sugar, syrup and spices.”</p>

<p>Doesn’t that sound good enough to eat?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where do the “little Turkeys” live?</p>

<p>How would you reach their country?</p>

<p>Describe the Turkish baby’s cradle.</p>

<p>Describe the princes’ cradle.</p>

<p>How does the Turkish boy go to school?</p>

<p>Tell what you can about the school.</p>

<p>What does the candy-man sell?</p>

<p>What are the candies made of, and what are they
called?</p>

<h2>“THE LITTLE TURKEYS”</h2>

<h3>AT HOME</h3>


<p>Little boys who like to lie in bed in the morning
would not like to live in Turkey.</p>

<p>All the grown people and all the children have to
get up twice every day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i-092.jpg" width="495" height="358" alt="chidlren and  man hodling tray of things to sell" />
</div>

<p>They get up first at day-break, wash their faces
and hands, and repeat their morning prayer. Then
they go back to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />89<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Two hours later they rise, wash, and have their coffee.
Breakfast is served two hours later still.</p>

<p>After breakfast the father goes to work and the
mother gets the children ready for school.</p>

<p>The children have their lunch at school, as I told
you. Dinner is served at night. If there are gentlemen
to dine with the father, only the sons sit at the table.
The mother and daughters dine in another room.</p>

<p>After dinner every one has a good time. The children
play games, and sometimes the older people play
with them. They are also fond of story telling, and tell
wonderful stories of battle and adventure.</p>

<p>Then the family goes to bed on the floor. That is,
they lay mattresses on the floor and cover themselves
with blankets.</p>

<p>Every one goes to church on Friday. The boys
sit with their father, and the girls sit with their mother
in a gallery where they cannot be seen. At the entrance
to the church they wash their hands and feet and put
on a pair of slippers.</p>

<p>After church the children play games of tag, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />90<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
hide-and-seek. They have few toys. The girls have
dolls, and the boys have marbles or balls. The
marbles are nothing but a kind of round nut.</p>

<p>They do not have the holidays you do, but there
are a few feast days, when they have a very good
time. One of the feasts is like our Easter, only it
lasts three days. Then there are merry-go-rounds in
the squares, and ponies to ride on for a penny.</p>

<p>The girls have new dresses of red, blue and yellow
silk, and the boys have gay little uniforms.</p>

<p>The candy-men walk the streets with big trays
piled high with sweets, and every one eats a great deal
too much candy.</p>

your own country best?</p>

<h2>“GILLYFLOWER GENTLEMAN”</h2>


<p>“Why do you play alone, dear,” asked the Play
Angel, “and look so sadly over your shoulder at
the other children?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/i-095.jpg" width="488" height="350" alt="angel talking to little girl who is feeling left out" />
</div>

<p>“Because they are so selfish!” said the child.
“They will not play with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a pity!” said the Angel. “Tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p>“I want to play one game, and they all want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />92<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
play another!” said the child. “It is very unkind of
them.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever play Gillyflower Gentleman?” asked
the Angel.</p>

<p>“No,” said the child. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“You shall see,” said the Angel. “Let us ask the
others if they know it.”</p>

<p>The other children did not know it, but they were
eager to learn, and soon they were all playing Gillyflower
Gentleman. They played till all their breath
was gone, and they had to sit down on the haycocks
to rest.</p>

<p>“That was a fine game!” said the first child. “I
will play yours now, if you wish me to.”</p>

<p>“We were just going to tell you that we would play
yours,” said the other children. So they played both
the games, and the Play Angel went back to her work.</p>

<h2>THE RULER</h2>


<p>It was time for the Child to have lessons. The
father gave him a sheet of paper, smooth and
white; a pencil, and a ruler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i-097.jpg" width="489" height="369" alt="man handing ruler to son" />
</div>

<p>“Write as well as you can,” he said, “and be sure
you keep the lines straight!”</p>

<p>The Child admired the ruler very much. “I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />94<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
put it up on the wall,” he said, “where I can see it
always.”</p>

<p>So he put it up on the wall, and the sunbeams
sparkled on it.</p>

<p>“It must be pure gold,” said the Child; “there is
nothing else so beautiful in the world.” And then he
began his task.</p>

<p>By and by the lesson time was over, and the father
came to see what had been done.</p>

<p>The Child showed him the paper on which he had
written his task. Up and down went the lines, here
and there, from side to side of the sheet, which was
covered with sprawling, straggling letters. There were
spots, too, where he had tried to rub out something.
It was not a pretty page.</p>

<p>“What is this?” asked the father. “Where is your
ruler?”</p>

<p>“There it is,” said the Child. “It is up on the
wall. It was so beautiful that I put it up there where
I could see it all the time. See where it hangs! But
it does not seem as bright as it was.”</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />95<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said the father. “It would have been
brighter if you had used it.”</p>

<p>“But I admired it very much,” said the Child.</p>

<p>“But your lines are crooked,” said the father.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN OF ARMENIA</h2>


<p>When you were a very little boy did you have a
“Noah’s Ark” for a plaything? And do you remember
the story of “Noah and his Ark?”</p>

<p>This story tells, you remember, about a severe storm,
when it rained forty days and forty nights and all the
land was flooded.</p>

<p>But Noah had built an ark and invited two animals
of every kind, and a few persons, to live in his ark
during the flood.</p>

<p>When the storms were over, the ark rested on a
mountain, and this was Mount Ararat.</p>

<p>Mount Ararat is in the country of Armenia, and in
this country lives a very interesting people.</p>

<p>Armenia is a mountainous country and Mount
Ararat is the highest of all the mountains. It is so
high that it has a snow cap all the year round, even
during the hottest part of the summer.</p>

<p>The Armenian children are often very pretty, with
black hair, black eyes, and round, red cheeks. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />97<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
are bright and anxious to learn, and they often ride a
long way on donkey-back to get to the church schools.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i-101.jpg" width="490" height="361" alt="three children on donkey" />
</div>

<p>The schools are not free like the school you go to,
and often the parents have to pay the school with
grain and cheese because they have no money.</p>

<p>There is a free school near every church, and the
priest is the teacher. Here the little boys and girls
learn the Armenian alphabet, and also study reading,
writing, geography, and grammar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />98<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The mirigs (mothers) of the little Armenians have
to wake them very early, for they have to go to
school at seven.</p>

<p>They sit cross-legged on the floor, and study their
lessons aloud. All the children carry a lunch from
home, and they eat together in another little room,
still sitting on the floor.</p>

<p>Boys and girls go to the same school until they
are ten or twelve years old; then the girls go to a
different school. Here they learn dressmaking and
embroidery. The materials are supplied by the
school, and at the end of the year the articles are
sold and the money goes to the school.</p>

<p>The boys do not earn money for the school, but they
have to sing in the church on Sunday.</p>

<p>When school closes at night the children form in
line, with their hands folded, and march to their
homes. The line stops at each house where a child
lives, while the little one bids his friends good-night.</p>

<p>In winter there are deep snows, and then Hagop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />99<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
(Jacob) and Garabet (George) and the other boys
build snowmen and have snowball battles.</p>

<p>But in summer they work more than they play,
for they have to go up to the mountains with herds
of goats. A few women go to cook for them, and they
all live in huts built of boughs.</p>

<p>The girls have rag dolls, with painted eyes, nose
and mouth, and very red cheeks. These dolls are dressed
just like the little girls, with gaily colored dresses
of red, green, purple, or yellow. Their hair is braided
in long braids, and strung with beads and coins.</p>

<h2>ARMENIAN HOMES</h2>


<p>Hagop and Garabet live at the foot of Mount Ararat
in a small village.</p>

<p>Their father is very poor and cannot afford to
build a house, so they live in a hut, built of mud,
with walls three feet thick.</p>

<p>The inside of the house is plastered with chopped
straw and mud mixed together. The mud roof is flat
and is kept smooth by rolling it often with a stone,
or treading it with bare feet. Hagop and Garabet
think it is great fun to go up on the roof after it rains
and tread the soft mud with their bare feet. Then
their father rolls it with a big round stone until it is
smooth and firm.</p>

<p>There are many huts like this in Armenia, and
they are often half under ground, with the earth
that has been dug out piled up around them. A
village of such dwellings looks a good deal like a
village of huge ant-hills.</p>

<p>There is only one door for the people and animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />101<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
Animals? Yes, animals. For in winter the poor
people let the animals come into the room with them,
and almost every family has at least a few goats.</p>

<p>There is a fireplace in the middle of the earth floor
for cooking, but there is no chimney, and the room
is very smoky.</p>

<p>The mother makes big thin sheets of blanket bread
and bakes it before the fire. Sometimes she makes
little cakes of the bread and spreads them with thick
cream.</p>

<p>The children drink goats’ milk with their bread,
and once in a long while they have a few raisins.</p>

<p>There are no windows in the hut, instead there are
a few holes for light; and there are no tables, no
chairs, no beds, no bureaus. In fact there is no furniture
except some mats and blankets. Hagop’s mother
weaves the mats and blankets herself. The children
like to watch the patterns grow on the rugs as the
mother weaves the colored threads back and
forth.</p>

<p>The people sit on the mats in the daytime and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />102<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
night they roll themselves in the blankets and sleep on
these same mats.</p>

<p>Of course the rich people in the towns and cities
have much more comfortable houses, and they often
have beautiful carved furniture and handsome rugs.
But these houses have flat roofs, too, and in summer
every one, rich or poor, lives on the roofs.</p>

or make beautiful lace; the little girls play with their
dolls; and at night the mats are spread and the family
sleep under the stars.</p>

<p>I do not believe I should like to live in Armenia,
but I should enjoy sleeping out of doors on the warm
summer nights, watching the twinkling stars until I
fell asleep.</p>

<h2>AHMOW—THE WOLF</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Little Ahmow was an Eskimo boy. He lived with
his parents on the bleak northern shore of Hudson
Bay.</p>

<p>During the long Arctic winter these Eskimos kill
the walrus which live at the edge of the ice. In the
short summer they hunt them on the islands near the
shore.</p>

<p>The walrus meat is cut into strips and sewed up in
bags made of the walrus skin. This is to keep the
dogs from stealing and eating it.</p>

<p>The walrus oil is put into casks to be used in the
dark winter months for heat and light.</p>

<p>Ahmow’s father killed many walrus every summer
and stored the meat and oil on the islands. Then in
the winter he rode over on the ice to get it.</p>

<p>One cold winter day, when Ahmow was ten years
old, his father said, “To-morrow I shall go to the
island for oil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />107<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“We need meat, too,” said his wife, “and food for
the dogs.”</p>

<p>“May I go with you, father?” said Ahmow. “I
will help you all I can.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/i-111.jpg" width="488" height="359" alt="child, dog and sled and igloo" />
</div>

<p>“No,” answered Nannook. “It is far and you are
only a boy.”</p>

<p>Ahmow begged so hard that at last his father said
he might go.</p>

<p>“But it will be a long cold ride, and there are often
bears and wolves on the island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />108<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>So Ahmow dressed himself in his new reindeer suit
that his mother had made, and pulled his sealskin
cap well over his ears.</p>

<p>He helped his father get ready for the long, cold
journey. First they put a thick coating of ice on the
sledge-runners. Then they filled two sealskin bags
with food and water.</p>

<p>They called the dogs and harnessed them to the
sledge. There were eight of them, and they could
run like the wind.</p>

<p>Last of all Ahmow crawled into the house, bade his
mother good-by, and brought out the long whip.</p>

<p>Nannook wrapped his little boy in a bearskin,
cracked his whip over the dogs, and away they flew
over the ice. Oh, how happy Ahmow was!</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>After a while the dogs stopped running and began
to trot, and Ahmow looked about over the vast fields
of ice.</p>

<p>Not a tree, not a house, not a person was in sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />109<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
As far as he could see there was nothing but ice and
snow. Everything was still and white in the dim light.</p>

<p>When they had nearly reached the island, what
did they see but a huge polar bear! He was prowling
around the oil casks, looking for something to eat.</p>

<p>Nannook unharnessed the dogs at once. “Go,”
he cried, and they raced across the ice after the bear.</p>

<p>The bear was so big and clumsy that he could not
run fast. The dogs soon surrounded him, and held
him until Nannook came running up to shoot him.</p>

<p>Ahmow helped his father skin the bear and cut up
the meat. Then they loaded the sledge with a cask of
oil, some walrus meat, the bearskin, and part of the
bear meat.</p>

<p>After eating their luncheon, Ahmow was again
rolled up in the bear rug, and they started for home.
Nannook walked beside the sledge. The dogs walked
too, because the load was so heavy.</p>

<p>When they were nearly halfway home, Nannook
saw some reindeer.</p>

<p>“Watch the dogs, Ahmow,” he said, “and I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />110<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
try to shoot one of those reindeer. Then we can have
a fine dinner.”</p>

<p>So he took the gun and ran swiftly over the snow.
Soon he was out of sight, and Ahmow was alone
with the dogs.</p>

<p>The little boy played with the dogs at first, but after
a while they curled up and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Ahmow was sleepy, too, and it was so warm in the
bear rug that he almost went to sleep.</p>

<p>All at once he heard a growl, then a dog barked.
Ahmow was wide awake and listening. “What is
it, Naka?” he said to the dog that barked.</p>

<p>Naka barked again, and the hair stood up straight
on his back.</p>

<p>Ahmow stood up and looked about. There was a
fierce, hungry-looking wolf coming toward him! He
looked again! One, two, three, four wolves were
leaping over the snow!</p>

<p>The boy threw off the rug, and seized his father’s
whip and walrus spear. “Come here,” he called to
the dogs. “Come here to the sledge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />111<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Then, as the wolves came nearer, he jumped into
the cask of meat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i-115.jpg" width="489" height="365" alt="boy being attacked by wolves" />
</div>

<p>One big wolf ran up to the sledge. Ahmow leaned
over and struck him with the whip with all his
might. The wolf howled and turned back.</p>

<p>Another wolf would have killed one of the dogs, but
Ahmow threw out a big piece of bear meat. The
wolf seized the meat and began to eat it.</p>

<p>Now a third wolf came up to the sledge. Just
then Ahmow saw his father running toward him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />112<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“He will drive the wolves away,” he thought,
“but I should like to kill one if I can.”</p>

<p>So he held the spear as he had seen his father hold
it. As the wolf came nearer, he raised it. As the
wolf jumped, he threw it with all his might right into
the wide-open mouth. There was a howl, a growl,
and then the wolf tried to run away. But Ahmow
wound the spear line around the sledge post and held
it tight.</p>

<p>Nannook shot two of the wolves, but the one that
had the meat got away with it.</p>

<p>Then as he ran to the sledge, “Look, father,”
cried Ahmow. “See this fine wolf, with the sharp
nose, and the bushy tail. He is held fast with the
walrus line, and he has eaten the walrus spear.”</p>

<p>“Well done, lad,” said his father. “You will be
a good hunter. Now, you shall have a spear of your
own and you shall go with me on the big hunts.”</p>

<p>So from that day the boy was a hunter, and the
people in the village called him “Ahmow,” which
means, “little wolf.”</p>

<h2>ESKIMO CHILDREN</h2>


<p>The Eskimos live in Greenland. I am sure you
would wonder why it is called “Greenland,” for
it is almost never “green.” Nearly all the year
round the ground is covered with ice and snow, so
that it seems as if “Whiteland” would be a better
name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i-117.jpg" width="490" height="357" alt="two children ice fishing" />
</div>

<p>It is so cold in Greenland that the Eskimos have
to wear very warm clothing. The boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />114<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
and men and women dress very much alike. They
wear trousers made of bearskin and coats made of
sealskin. Their stockings are like leggings and are
made of birdskin, with soft feathers inside to keep
their feet warm. Over these they wear sealskin
boots, which are long enough to cover their knees.</p>

<p>It is so cold in Greenland that trees cannot grow.
If you think of all the ways in which we use the wood
from our forest trees you will wonder what the Eskimos
can do without them.</p>

<p>We build houses of wood, but the Eskimos make
theirs of blocks of ice and snow.</p>

<p>We burn wood in our stoves. The Eskimos burn
oil and fat which they get from the walrus and the
seal. They burn this oil in a lamp which gives them
all the light and heat they have.</p>

<p>Our beds, chairs and tables are made of wood. The
Eskimos have no beds. They sleep on bearskin rugs.</p>

<p>They have no tables and no chairs. A big bowl
made of bone is set on the floor, and the family sit
around the bowl on bearskins, and eat out of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />115<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>There are no stores in Greenland, no churches,
and no schools. Everything that a family needs has
to be provided by the father or the mother. The
father goes hunting and fishing, to get food to eat,
and oil to burn, and skins to wear. He catches fish,
and kills bears, seals, walrus, and reindeer. Sometimes
in the summer he kills a few birds.</p>

<p>The mother helps cut up the meat, and sometimes
she cooks it, but much of the meat and fat is eaten
raw. From the skins and furs she makes all the
clothing for her family.</p>

<p>As there are no schools the Eskimo children never
learn to read or write, but they like to hear their mother
and father tell stories, and they learn these stories
so that they can tell them to their children.</p>

<p>Every one in Greenland has a sled. The runners
are made of bone, and the top is made of sealskin.
Dogs draw these sleds over the snow, and they can
run very fast and very far.</p>

<p>The boys and girls have very few toys, but they
like to play games, and they have many good times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />116<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The girls have dolls made of bone, and the boys
play a game with a ball and stick made of bone.</p>

<p>But the boys like to hunt and fish. They have
small boats made of bone and sealskin, and paddles
made of bone. Of course they can use these boats
only in the short summer time, as the water is frozen
the rest of the year. When they go hunting they
carry spears, and a bow and arrows.</p>

<h2>A TRIP TO JAPAN</h2>


<p>There are so many things to tell you about “Nippon,”
as the Japanese call their country, that I do
not know where to begin.</p>

<p>But first of all I must tell you how we landed.
There were six of us,—Charlotte and Alice and
Fred, their father and mother, and I,—and we had
come all the way across the Pacific Ocean in a big
ship.</p>

<p>Our ship was anchored out in the harbor, and we
were told we might go ashore.</p>

<p>We wondered if we were expected to swim, but it
seemed too far for that.</p>

<p>You can imagine how glad we were when we looked
over the side of the ship and saw a great many little
boats waiting for us.</p>

<p>A stairway was hung out over the side of the ship,
and we walked down into the little boats, just as we
walk down stairs in our houses.</p>

<p>Then the trunks were lowered by ropes into little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />119<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
Japanese rowboats, called sampans, and we waved
“good-by” to the captain and all our friends on the
ship.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 490px;">
<img src="images/i-123.jpg" width="490" height="361" alt="woman with parsol in rickshaw" />
</div>

<p>Did you ever go to sleep and dream you were in a
doll’s country, where you seemed like a giant? Alice
said she knew now just how that other Alice felt in
her visit to Wonderland, for she never saw such tiny
little people, and such tiny little houses, and even such
tiny little trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />120<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>When we got on shore we found queer little two-wheeled
carriages, drawn by men instead of horses.
The carriages are called jinrikishas, and are just big
enough for one person.</p>

<p>We each got into one of these carriages and the
jinrikisha boys picked up the shafts and trotted off
like nice little ponies.</p>

<p>These boys wear dark-blue trousers that fit their
legs very tightly, and a short blue jacket with flowing
sleeves, and on their back is a Chinese letter painted
in white, which is their employer’s name.</p>

<p>On their feet they wear straw sandals which they
kick off, when they are worn out, as a horse casts his
shoe. The hat is a funny round straw disk, covered
with white, which makes them look like toadstools.</p>

<p>The houses, as I said, are very tiny, not much
larger than your playhouses, and the walls are all
made of sliding screens that can be pushed aside,
leaving the house open.</p>

<p>The floors are covered with matting, which is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />121<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
soft as cushions, but there is no furniture anywhere
to be seen, for the Japanese sit on the floor and sleep
on the floor, and their tables are tiny little trays.</p>

<p>The houses are spotlessly clean, for no Japanese
would think of going into a house with his shoes on,
any more than you would walk over your mother’s
chairs and cushions in your shoes.</p>

<p>One day we went to see a wonderful image. We
rode out to it in jinrikishas, and we each had two
’rikisha boys to pull us. We sped along at a rapid
pace, for the boys are so well trained that they make
nearly as good time as a horse, and a day’s run is
sometimes as much as forty miles.</p>

<p>We had a regular Japanese “tiffin,” or lunch, at
a little Japanese inn that had a pretty garden all
around it. We took off our shoes at the door just as
the Japanese do, and walked across the soft, matted
floor.</p>

<p>A screen was drawn aside for us to enter, and then
closed again, leaving us in a little room. Here we all
squatted on our heels, as nearly like a Japanese as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />122<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
our stiff muscles would let us, for, without being
trained, it is hard to shut up like a jackknife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i-126.jpg" width="491" height="360" alt="woman in kimono carrying tea set iinto room" />
</div>

<p>Then pretty little Japanese girls stole in noiselessly,
bringing us trays of food, one for each person, and
knelt down beside us to uncover our dishes and wait
on us.</p>

<p>In one tiny bowl was some vegetable soup, in
another some rice, and in a third some fish, which
was cooked for us, though to have been truly Japanese
we should have eaten it raw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />123<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Of course there was tea. Everywhere you go they
give you tea in wee cups without handles; just about
a thimbleful, without cream and without sugar;
not at all as we drink it at home.</p>

<p>But with all this feast before us, there was nothing
to eat it with but two funny little chopsticks, and
terrible times we had trying to manage those little
sticks that serve the Japanese so well, but which
seemed bewitched the minute we got them between
our fingers.</p>

<p>After trying a long time we would get a mouthful,
as we thought, firmly fixed between the chopsticks,
but just as we would open our mouths to take it in,
the bewitched chopsticks would give a twitch, and
down the whole thing would fall again.</p>

<p>So, though we spent much time over it, we ate
very little, and we all agreed that it is better to eat
with forks as we do in America.</p>

<p>After tiffin we went to a silk factory, for a great
deal of silk is manufactured in Japan. There we
found over three thousand girls and women busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />124<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
unrolling the cocoons. The silk is woven in another
place, and rolled in neat rolls, ready for sale.</p>

<p>Most of the way we rode along the beach, where
we could see the fishermen in their boats, and in one
boat was a boy we called Urashima, for when we
looked for him a second time he had disappeared.</p>

<h2>URASHIMA</h2>


<p>Urashima was a fisher-boy who lived long ago in
Japan.</p>

<p>One day he went out in his boat, and after he had
been fishing a little while, he felt something very heavy
tugging at his line.</p>

<p>He gave a hard pull and got it up into his boat.
Then he found that it was a big tortoise with such
a funny old wrinkled face that he burst out laughing
when he saw it.</p>

<p>In Japan a tortoise lives a thousand years, so Urashima
thought it would be a shame to kill this funny
old fellow, when he might have so long to live. Besides,
a small fish would suit him just as well for
dinner, so he threw the tortoise back into the sea, and
meant to go on fishing.</p>

<p>But somehow the air seemed too heavy and drowsy,
just as it does on a summer’s day, and Urashima fell
asleep.</p>

<p>While he was sleeping a beautiful maiden rose out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />126<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
of the water and got into the boat with him. Urashima
waked, and when he saw her he thought she
was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen.</p>

<p>The maiden spoke to him. “Urashima,” she said,
“you thought you caught a tortoise a little while ago,
but it was really me. My father had sent me in disguise
to see if you were a good, kind boy.</p>

<p>“We know now that you are kind-hearted, as you
spared the life of the old tortoise. So I am going to
take you with me to the Dragon Palace, where my
father, the Sea King, and I live. There you shall
marry me, and we shall be very happy.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<img src="images/i-131.jpg" width="506" height="684" alt="Woman and boy in boat surrounded by lilies" />
<div class="caption">I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU WITH ME TO THE DRAGON PALACE.</div>
</div>

<p>Urashima gladly consented, and they floated away
till they came to a wonderful palace at the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>This palace was all built of the most beautiful pink
and white coral, and was studded with diamonds and
pearls.</p>

<p>The leaves of the trees were emeralds, with berries
of rubies and sapphires; and the fishes’ scales were of
pure silver and gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />127<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>All this was given to Urashima, and the beautiful
princess became his wife. Any boy would be happy
in such a palace, and Urashima was happy for three
years.</p>

<p>Then he said to the princess, “I must go to see my
father and mother, and my brothers and sisters, but I
will return again to you.”</p>

<p>This made the poor princess very sad, for she did
not wish to have Urashima go away.</p>

<p>But when she saw how much he wished to go, she
gave him a little box to take with him, telling him
under no conditions to open it, for if he did he could
never return to her.</p>

<p>So Urashima started off, and soon found himself
on the shore where he had lived. But everything seemed
strangely different. Even the people were different
and looked at him in a curious way.</p>

<p>He could not seem to find his way home, so he asked
two men whom he met if they could tell him how to
reach the house of Urashima’s parents.</p>

<p>“Urashima!” they cried. “Why, he was drowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />128<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
out fishing about four hundred years ago, and not even
his body was found. His father and mother are
buried over there.”</p>

<p>Then they moved away hastily, for they thought
he must be insane.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i-134.jpg" width="491" height="358" alt="boy releasing cloud" />
</div>

<p>Poor Urashima could not think what to do. He
began to think that the Dragon Palace must be a part
of Fairyland, where a day is the same as a year on
earth, and he wished to return to it. But how could he
find the way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />129<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>He could not remember how he had come.</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought of the box that the princess
had given him, and forgetting that he had promised
not to open it, he pulled open the lid, hoping to learn
the way back.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the box but a fleecy white
cloud that floated softly up into the blue sky.</p>

<p>Then, too late, he remembered what the princess
had said, and he called and called the cloud to come
back. He even ran along the beach trying to catch it.</p>

<p>But soon he could not call, for his breath came
shorter and shorter, his hair turned white, and his
back became weak and bent.</p>

<p>Finally he fell down on the beach, crushed by the
weight of his four hundred years.</p>

<h2>THE ANTS’ MONDAY DINNER</h2>


<p>How did I know what the ants had for dinner last
Monday? It is odd that I should have known, but
I’ll tell you how it happened.</p>

<p>I was sitting under a big pine tree, high up on a hillside.
The hillside was more than seven thousand
feet above the sea, and that is higher than many mountains
which people travel hundreds of miles to look at.
But this hillside was in Colorado, so there was nothing
wonderful in being up so high.</p>

<p>I had been watching the great mountains with snow
on them, and the great forests of pine trees—miles
and miles of them—so close together that it looks
as if you could lie down on their tops and not fall
through; and my eyes were tired with looking at
such great, grand things, so many miles off.</p>

<p>So I looked down on the ground where I was sitting,
and watched the ants which were running about
everywhere, as busy and restless as if they had the
whole world on their shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />132<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a tiny caterpillar, which seemed
to be bounding along in a very strange way. In a
second more I saw an ant seize hold of him and begin
to drag him off.</p>

<p>The caterpillar was three times as long as the ant,
and his body was more than twice as large round as
the biggest part of the ant’s body.</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! Mr. Ant,” said I, “you needn’t think
you’re going to be strong enough to drag that fellow
very far.”</p>

<p>Why, it was about the same thing as if you or I
should drag off a calf, which was kicking and struggling
all the time; only that the calf hasn’t half so many
legs to catch hold of things with as the caterpillar
had.</p>

<p>Poor caterpillar! how he did try to get away!
But the ant never gave him a second’s time to take a
good grip of anything; and he was cunning enough,
too, to drag him on his side, so that he couldn’t use
his legs very well.</p>

<p>Up and down, and under and over stones and sticks;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />133<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
in and out of tufts of grass; up to the very top of the
tallest blades, and then down again; over gravel and
sand, and across bridges of pine needles from stone
to stone; backward all the way ran that ant, dragging
the caterpillar after him.</p>

<p>I watched him very closely, thinking, of course,
he must be going toward his house. Presently he
darted up the trunk of a pine tree.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said I, “ants don’t live in trees! What
does this mean?”</p>

<p>The bark of the tree was all broken and jagged, and
full of seams twenty times as deep as the height of the
ant’s body. But he didn’t mind; down one side and
up the other he went.</p>

<p>They must have been awful chasms to him, and yet
he never once stopped or went a bit slower. I had
to watch the ant very closely, not to lose sight of him
altogether.</p>

<p>I began to think that he was merely trying to kill
the caterpillar; that, perhaps, he didn’t mean to eat
him, after all. How did I know but some ants might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />134<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
hunt caterpillars, just as some men hunt deer, for
fun, and not at all because they need food?</p>

<p>If I had been sure of this, I would have spoiled Mr.
Ant’s sport for him very soon, you may be sure, and
set the poor caterpillar free. But I never heard of an
ant’s being cruel; and if it were really for dinner
for his family that he was working so hard, I thought
he ought to be helped, and not hindered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/i-140.jpg" width="487" height="364" alt="hawk and two birds" />
</div>

<p>Just then I heard a sharp cry overhead. I looked
up, and there was an enormous hawk, sailing round in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />135<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
circles, with two small birds flying after him. They
were pouncing down on his head, and then darting
away, and all the time making shrill cries of fright and
hatred.</p>

<p>I knew very well what that meant. Mr. Hawk
was also out trying to do some marketing for his dinner.
He had his eye on some little birds in their nest, and
there were the father and mother birds driving him
away.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t have believed that two such little birds
could drive off such a big creature as the hawk, but
they did. They seemed to fairly buzz round his head
just as flies buzz round a horse’s head.</p>

<p>At last he gave up the quest and flew off so far
that he vanished in the blue sky, and the little birds
came skimming home again into the forest.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said I, “the little people are stronger
than the big ones, after all! Where has my ant
gone?”</p>

<p>Sure enough! It hadn’t been two minutes that I
had been watching the hawk and the birds, but in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />136<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
two minutes the ant and the caterpillar had disappeared.
At last I found them,—where do you think? In a
fold of my coat, on which I was sitting!</p>

<p>The ant was running round and round the caterpillar.
I shook the fold out, and as soon as the cloth
lay straight and smooth, the ant fastened his nippers
into his prey and started off as fast as ever.</p>

<p>I suppose if I could have seen his face, and had
understood the language of ants’ features, I should
have seen plainly written there, “Dear me, what sort
of a country was that I tumbled into?”</p>

<p>By this time the caterpillar had had the breath pretty
well knocked out of his body, and was so limp and helpless
that the ant was not afraid of his getting away
from him. So he stopped now and then to rest.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would spring on the caterpillar’s back,
and stretch himself out there; sometimes he would
stand still on one side and look at him sharply, keeping
one nipper on his head.</p>

<p>All the time he was working steadily in one direction;
he was headed for home I felt certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />137<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>It astonished me very much, at first, that none of the
ants he met took any notice of him; they all went on
their own way, and never took so much as a sniff
at the caterpillar.</p>

<p>But pretty soon I said to myself, “You stupid
woman, not to suppose that ants can be as well behaved
as people! When you passed Mr. Jones yesterday,
you didn’t peep into his market-basket, nor
touch the cabbage he had under his arm.”</p>

<p>Presently the ant dropped the caterpillar, and ran
on a few steps—I mean inches—to meet another
ant who was coming towards him. They put their
heads close together for a second.</p>

<p>I could not hear what they said, but I could easily
imagine, for they both ran quickly back to the caterpillar,
and one took him by the head and the other by
the tail, and then they lugged him along finely. It
was only a few steps, however, to the ant’s house;
that was the reason he happened to meet this friend
just coming out.</p>

<p>The door was a round hole in the ground, about as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />138<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
big as my little finger. Several ants were standing
in the doorway, watching these two come up with
the caterpillar. They all took hold as soon as the
caterpillar was on the doorstep, and almost before
I knew he was there, they had tumbled him down,
heels over head, into the ground, and that was the
last I saw of him.</p>

<p>The oddest thing was, how the ants came running
home from all directions. I don’t believe there was
any dinner bell rung, though there might have been
one too fine for my ears to hear; but in a minute, I
counted thirty-three ants running down that hole.
I fancied they looked as hungry as wolves.</p>

<p>I had a great mind to dig down into the hole with a
stick, and see what had become of the caterpillar.
But I thought it wasn’t quite fair to take the roof off
a man’s house to find out how he cooks his beef for
dinner; so I sat still and wondered whether they
would eat him all up or whether they would leave any
for Tuesday; then I went home to my own dinner.</p>

<h2>MY ANT’S COW</h2>


<p>My Ant lives in the country and keeps a cow. I
am ashamed to say that, although I have always known
she was a most interesting person, I never went to see
her until last week.</p>

<p>I am afraid I should not have gone then, if I had
not found an account of her, and her house, and her
cow, in a book which I was reading.</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said I, “and there she has been living
so near me all this time, and I never have been to call
on her.”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, it was much worse than that;
I had often met her in the street, and had taken such
a dislike to her looks that I always brushed by as
quickly as possible without speaking to her.</p>

<p>I had great difficulty in finding her house, though it
is quite large. She belongs to a very peculiar family;
they prefer to live in the dark; so they have no windows
in their houses, only doors; and the doors are
nothing but holes in the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />140<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The houses are built in the shape of a mound, and
are not more than ten inches high. They are built
out of old bits of wood, dead leaves, straw, old bones;
in short, every sort of old thing that they find, they
stick in the walls of their houses. Their best rooms
are all down cellar; and dark enough they must be
on a rainy day, when the doors are always kept shut
tight.</p>

<p>But I ought to have told you about my Ant herself
before I told you about her house. When you hear
what an odd person she is, you will not be surprised
that she lives in such an outlandish house.</p>

<p>To begin with, I must tell you that she belongs to a
family that never does any work.</p>

<p>You’d never suppose so, to see her. I really think
she is the queerest-looking creature I ever met.</p>

<p>In the first place, her skin is of a dark brown color,
darker than an Indian’s, and she has six legs. Of
course she can walk three times as fast as if she had
only two,—but I would rather go slower and be more
like other people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />141<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>She has frightful jaws, with which she does all sorts
of things besides eating. She uses them for scissors,
tweezers, pickaxes, knife and fork, and in case of a
battle, for swords.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/i-146.jpg" width="493" height="357" alt="shoe surrounded by many ants" />
</div>

<p>Then she has growing out of the front part of her
head two long slender horns, which she keeps moving
about all the time, and with which she touches everything
she wishes to understand.</p>

<p>The first thing she does, when she meets you, is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />142<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
bend both these horns straight towards you, and feel
of you. It is quite disagreeable,—almost as bad
as shaking hands with strangers.</p>

<p>My Ant’s name is Fornica Rufa. If I knew her
better I should call her Ant Ru, for short. But I do
not expect ever to know her very well. She evidently
does not like to be intimate with anybody but her own
family; and I am not surprised, for I was never in any
house so overrun with people as hers is. I wondered
how they knew themselves apart.</p>

<p>When I went to see her last week I found her just
going out, and I thought perhaps that was one reason
that she didn’t take any more notice of me.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Ant?” said I. “I am spending
the summer near by, and thought I would like to become
acquainted with you. I hear you have a very
curious cow, and I have a great desire to see it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said she, and snapped her horns up
and down, as she always does when she is displeased, I
find.</p>

<p>“I hope it will not give you any trouble to show her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />143<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
to me. You must be very proud of having such a fine
cow. Perhaps you are on the way to milking now,
and if so I should be most happy to go with you.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said my Ant again. At least I think
that was what she said. It looked like it, but I can’t
say that I heard any sound.</p>

<p>But she turned short on her heels (I suppose she has
heels), and plunged into the woods at the right, stopping
and looking back at me as if she expected me to follow.
So I stepped along after her as fast as I could, and said,
“Thank you; I suppose this is the way to the pasture.”</p>

<p>My Ant said nothing, but went ahead, snapping her
horns furiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” thought I to myself, “you are an
uncivil Ant. Even if I have come simply out of
curiosity, you might be a little more polite in your
own house, or at least on your own grounds, which
is the same thing. I sha’n’t speak to you again.”</p>

<p>That’s about all the conversation I have ever had
with my Ant. But she took me to the pasture, and
I saw her cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />144<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>I am almost afraid to tell you where the pasture
was, and what the cow was; but if you don’t believe
me, you can look in books written about such things,
and they will prove to you that every word I say is
true.</p>

<p>The pasture was the stalk of a green brier; and
there stood, not only my Ant’s cow, but as many
as five hundred others, all feeding away upon it. You
have seen millions of them in your lives, for you must
know that they are nothing but little green plant-lice,
like those that we find on our rosebushes, and that
we try in every possible way to get rid of.</p>

<p>Who would ever suppose there could be anything
for which these little green plant-lice could serve
as cows! I assure you it is true, and if you live in the
country you can see it for yourself; but you will have
to look through a magnifying glass to see them milked.</p>

<p>Think of looking through a magnifying glass at
anybody’s cow! I looked at my Ant’s for an hour,
and it seemed to me I hardly winked, I was so much
interested in the curious sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />145<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Its skin was smooth as satin and of a most beautiful
light green color. It had six legs, and little hooks
at the end, instead of hoofs. The oddest thing of all
was that the horns were not on its head, but at the
other end of its body, where the tail would have been
if it had had a tail like any other cow.</p>

<p>The horns were hollow tubes, and it is out of them
that the milk comes, a drop at a time. The milk is
meant for the little plant-lice to drink before they
are old enough to hook their six legs on to stalks and
leaves, and feed on sap.</p>

<p>But I think that in any place where there are many
of my Ant’s race, the little plant-lice must fare badly,
for the Ants are so fond of this milk that sometimes
they carry off whole herds of the plant-lice and shut
them up in chambers in their houses. There they
feed them as we do cows in barns, and go and milk
them whenever they please.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Ant,” said I to my Ant, “do pray milk
your cow! I have such a desire to see how you do it.”</p>

<p>She did not appear to understand me, and I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />146<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
say if she had she would not have done it any sooner.
But presently I saw her go up behind her cow, and
begin to tap her gently on her back, just at the place
where the horns grew out.</p>

<p>The cow did not look round nor stop eating, but in a
moment out came a tiny drop of liquid from the tip
of each tube. My Ant picked it up with her wonderful
horns and whisked it into her mouth as quickly as
you would a sugarplum.</p>

<p>Then she went on to the next cow and milked that
in the same manner, and then to a third one. She
took only two drops from each one. Perhaps that is
all that this kind of a cow can give at a time.</p>

<p>There were several of her friends there at the same
time doing their milking; and I could not help thinking
how easy it would be for the great herd of cows to kill
my Ant and all her race, if they chose. But it is
thought by wise people who have studied these wonderful
things that the cows are fond of being milked
in this way, and would be sorry to be left alone by
themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />147<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>After my Ant had finished her supper, she stood
still watching the cows for some time. I thought perhaps
she would be in a better humor after having
had so much to eat, and might possibly feel like talking
with me. But she never once opened her mouth, though
I sat there an hour and a half.</p>

<p>At last it began to grow dark, and as I had quite a
long walk to take, I knew I must go, or I should not
get home in time for my own supper of milk.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Ant,” said I. “I have had a charming
visit. I am very much obliged to you for showing
me your cow. I think she is the most wonderful
creature I ever saw. I should be very happy to see
you at my house.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said my Ant.</p>

<h2>THE PETERKINS’ EXCURSION AFTER MAPLE
SYRUP</h2>


<p>The Peterkins had decided not to go to Egypt.</p>

<p>Of course the little boys were very much disappointed,
so Mr. Peterkin said that he would take them
out into the woods to get some maple syrup instead.
But it was almost as difficult to arrange an excursion
for maple sugar as to arrange for a trip to Egypt.</p>

<p>You see, sugar can not be made until it is
warm enough to make the sap run. On the other
hand, it must be cold enough for snow, as you can
only reach the woods on snow-sleds.</p>

<p>Now, if there were sun enough for the sap to rise,
it would melt the snow; and if it were cold enough for
sledding, it must be too cold for the syrup. The little
boys, however, said there always had been maple
sugar every spring,—they had eaten it; why shouldn’t
there be this spring?</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza said that this was probably old sugar
they had eaten,—you never could tell in the shops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />154<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Peterkin thought there must be fresh sugar
once in a while, as the old sugar would be eaten up.
She felt the same about chickens. She never could
understand why there were only the old, tough ones
in the market, when there were certainly fresh young
broods to be seen around the farmhouses every
year.</p>

<p>She supposed the market-men had begun with the
old, tough fowls, and so they had to go on so. She
wished they had begun the other way; and she had
done her best to have the family eat up the old fowls,
hoping they might, some day, get down to the young
ones.</p>

<p>As to the weather, she suggested they should go to
Grandfather’s the day before. But how can you go
the day before, when you don’t know the day?</p>

<p>All were much delighted, therefore, when Hiram
appeared with the wood-sled, one evening, to take
them, as early as possible the next day, to their grandfather’s.</p>

<p>He said that the sap had started, the kettles had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />155<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
on some time, there had been a slight snow for sleighing,
and to-morrow promised to be a fine day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/i-161.jpg" width="458" height="336" alt="packing up furniture" />
</div>

<p>It was decided that he should take the little boys and
Elizabeth Eliza in the wood-sled; the others would
follow later, in the carryall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterkin thought it would be safer to have
some of the party go on wheels, in case of a thaw the
next day.</p>

<p>A brilliant sun awoke them in the morning. The
wood-sled was filled with hay, to make it warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />156<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
comfortable, and an armchair was tied in for Elizabeth
Eliza.</p>

<p>The little boys put on their India-rubber boots and
their red mittens. Elizabeth Eliza took a shawl, a
hot brick, and a big bag of cookies, and they started off.</p>

<p>In passing the school-house the little boys saw five
of their friends, who had reached the school door a full
hour before the time. They asked these five boys to
go with them, but Elizabeth Eliza thought they ought
to inquire if their parents would be willing they should
go, as they all expected to spend the night at Grandfather’s.</p>

<p>Hiram thought it would take too much time to ask
all the parents; if the sun kept on shining so brightly,
the snow would be gone before they would reach the
woods.</p>

<p>But the little boys said that most of these boys lived
in a row, and Elizabeth Eliza felt she ought not to take
the boys away for all night without asking their
parents.</p>

<p>At each place they were obliged to stop for tippets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />157<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
and great-coats and India-rubber boots for the little
boys. At the Harrimans’, too, the Harriman girls
insisted on dressing up the wood-sled with evergreens,
and made one of the boys bring the Christmas tree
that was leaning up against the barn, to set it up in
the back of the sled, over Elizabeth Eliza.</p>

<p>All this took a good deal of time; and when they
reached the highroad again, the snow was indeed fast
melting. Elizabeth Eliza thought they ought to turn
back, but Hiram said they would find the sleighing
better farther up among the hills.</p>

<p>The armchair joggled about a good deal, and the
Christmas tree creaked and swayed, and Hiram was
obliged to stop once in a while and tie in the chair and
the tree more firmly.</p>

<p>But the warm sun was very pleasant, the eight little
boys were very lively, and the sleigh bells jingled gaily
as they went on.</p>

<p>It was so late when they reached the wood-road
that Hiram decided they had better not go up the
hill to their grandfather’s, but turn off into the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />158<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Your grandfather will be up at the sugar camp
by this time,” he declared.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza was afraid the carryall would miss
them, and thought they had better wait. Hiram
did not like to wait longer, and said that one or two
of the little boys could stop to show the way.</p>

<p>But it was so difficult to decide which little boys
should stay that he gave it up. So he explained that
there was a lunch hidden somewhere in the straw;
and the little boys thought this was a good time to eat
it, so they decided to stop in the sun at the corner of
the road.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Eliza felt a little jounced in the armchair,
and was glad of a rest; and the boys soon discovered
a good lunch,—just what might have been expected
from Grandfather’s,—apple pie and doughnuts, and
plenty of them! “It is lucky we brought so many
little boys!” they exclaimed.</p>

<p>Hiram, however, began to grow impatient. “There’ll
be no snow left,” he exclaimed, “and no afternoon for
the syrup!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />159<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>But far in the distance the Peterkin carryall was
seen slowly approaching through the snow, Solomon
John waving a red handkerchief. The little boys
waved back, and Hiram turned the sled into the wood-road,
but he drove slowly, as Elizabeth Eliza still
feared that by some accident the family might miss
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/i-165.jpg" width="460" height="335" alt="carriage making way through snow" />
</div>

<p>It was difficult for the carryall to follow in the deep
but soft snow, in among the trunks of the trees and
over piles of leaves hidden in the snow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />160<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>At last they reached the edge of a meadow. On
the high bank above it stood a row of maples, and
back of which was a little shanty with smoke coming
out of its chimney. The little boys screamed with
delight, but there was no reply. Nobody there!</p>

<p>“The folks all gone!” exclaimed Hiram; “then we
must be late.” And he proceeded to pull out a large
silver watch from a side pocket. It was so large that
he seldom was at the pains to pull it out, as it took
time; but when he had succeeded at last, and looked at
it, he started.</p>

<p>“Late, indeed! It is four o’clock, and we were to
have been here by eleven; they have given you
up.”</p>

<p>The little boys wanted to force in the door; but
Hiram said it was no use,—they wouldn’t understand
what to do, and he should have to see to the
horses,—and it was too late, and very likely the men
had carried off all the syrup.</p>

<p>But he thought a minute, as they all stood in silence
and gloom; and then he guessed they might find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />161<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
sugar at Deacon Spear’s, close by, on the back road, and
that would be better than nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterkin was pretty cold, and glad not to wait
in the darkening wood; so the eight little boys walked
through the wood-path, Hiram leading the way; and
slowly the carryall followed.</p>

<p>They reached Deacon Spear’s at length; but only
Mrs. Spear was at home. She was very deaf, but could
explain that the family had taken all their syrup to
the sugar festival.</p>

<p>“We might go to the festival,” exclaimed the boys.</p>

<p>“It would be very well,” said Mrs. Peterkin, “to
eat our fresh syrup there.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Spear could not tell where the festival was
to be, as she had not heard; perhaps they might know
at Squire Ramsay’s.</p>

<p>Squire Ramsay’s was on their way to Grandfather’s,
so they stopped there. They were told that the
“Squire’s folks” had all gone with their syrup to the
festival. The man who was chopping wood did not
know where the festival was to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />162<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“They’ll know at your grandfather’s,” said Mrs.
Peterkin, from the carryall.</p>

<p>“Yes, go on to your grandfather’s,” advised Mr.
Peterkin, “for I think I felt a drop of rain.” So
they made the best of their way to Grandfather’s.</p>

<p>At the moment they reached the door of the house,
a party of young people whom Elizabeth Eliza knew
came by in sleighs. She had met them all when visiting
at her grandfather’s.</p>

<p>“Come along with us,” they shouted; “we are all
going down to the sugar festival.”</p>

<p>“That is what we have come for,” said Mr. Peterkin.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Solomon John.</p>

<p>“It is down your way,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“It is in your own New Hall,” said another. “We
have sent down all our syrup. The Spears and Ramsays
and Doolittles have gone on with theirs. No time to
stop; there’s good sleighing on the old road.”</p>

<p>Hiram said he could take them back with the wood-sled,
when he heard there was sleighing on the old road.
So it was decided that the whole party should go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />163<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
the wood-sled, with the exception of Mr. Peterkin,
who would follow on with the carryall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peterkin would take the armchair, and cushions
were put in for Elizabeth Eliza, and more apple pie
for all. No more drops of rain appeared, though the
clouds were thickening over the setting sun.</p>

<p>“All the way back again,” sighed Mrs. Peterkin,
“when we might have stayed at home all day, and gone
quietly out to the New Hall!” But the little boys
thought the sledding was great fun,—and the
apple pie! “And we did see the kettle through the
cracks of the shanty!”</p>

<h2>THE BABY SQUIRRELS</h2>


<p>The four baby squirrels were tired of staying in their
soft nest in the hollow tree. They wanted to find out
what was going on in the world outside.</p>

<p>As they cuddled together in the shadowy hole they
could hear the queerest sounds. They cocked their
heads curiously at the rustling and whispering of the
wind among the leaves. They heard chirping and singing,
and a silvery tinkle, tinkle from the brook.</p>

<p>Once a bee flew buzzing right over their heads, and
made them clutch one another in terror.</p>

<p>One morning, when the old mother squirrel was
away hunting for birds’ eggs to eat, the smallest
baby crept to the mouth of the hole and peeped out
with his round bright eyes.</p>

<p>All around and above him there were wonderful
green things flickering and fluttering. Twinkles of
sunlight danced through the leaves and dazzled him.
Something soft and cool blew back the new bristles
on his lips and ruffled his satiny red fur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />167<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>He was so much interested that he sat there, staring
and staring, till the other little ones began to squeak
and scold him for shutting out the light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/i-173.jpg" width="485" height="350" alt="squirrels peeking out of tree trunk" />
</div>

<p>After he crept down again to the nest the others
climbed up, one by one, and looked out. They blinked
and winked at each wonderful sight; they sniffed the
strange odors, and twitched their eager little heads
at every new sound.</p>

<p>The scream of a blue jay in the tree-top above them
sent them scampering inside again, to cuddle close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />168<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
together in the darkest corner. It was fun to see
something new and exciting, even if it did make them
shiver all over.</p>

<p>Soon the mother squirrel came springing from branch
to branch to reach the hollow.</p>

<p>How the babies squeaked and chattered in welcome!
Very likely they told her about the wonderful
sights and sounds in the strange world outside the
hole.</p>

<p>The smallest one clasped his fore paws around her
neck, and coaxed her to let them all go out to find
more interesting things. It was stupid there in the
dark nest, with nothing to watch except the patch of
light across the opening above them.</p>

<p>The old squirrel knew that the little ones were not
strong enough yet to leave the nest.</p>

<p>To be sure, they had grown and changed very much
since the first days. Then they had been ugly little
creatures, like tiny pug dogs, with big heads, no fur,
and their eyes tight shut.</p>

<p>Now they were half as big as she was herself. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />169<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
eyes were like jewels, and their red fur was smooth as
satin.</p>

<p>But their tails, with only fringes of hair along the
sides, were not nearly so fluffy as the mother’s. Her
tail was long and plumy. It curved so gracefully
over her back that she seemed to be sitting in its
shadow. One name of the squirrel is “shadow-tail.”</p>

<p>For a few weeks longer the four babies scrambled
about the doorway and looked longingly out at the
wonderful green tree-world. They did not dare to step
out upon the slender branches, for fear of falling off.</p>

<p>It made them feel dizzy to look away down to the
ground below. They did not know how to cling to the
limbs with their feet while they balanced themselves
with their tails.</p>

<p>When the young squirrels were almost strong enough
to learn to run and climb in the tree, the mother began
to build another home higher up the trunk. The old
nest was growing too warm for comfort, as summer
brought the long sunny hours.</p>

<p>The squirrel father was not there to help his mate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />170<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The mother squirrel thought the tree belonged to
her, and that she needed all the room in the hollow
for her little ones. She chased him off to live in the
woods with all the other squirrel fathers till the babies
were big enough to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The mother squirrel worked on the new nest in the
early morning. She bit off leafy twigs and carried them
to the top of the tree. There, where two branches
forked, she packed the sticks and leaves together
in a loose ball.</p>

<p>Then she pushed a doorway through, at one side or
another, just as she happened to be standing.</p>

<p>This was not such a neat home as one in the next
tree. That other mother squirrel built her new nest
of strips of bark tied together with ribbons of soft
fibre. Over the doorway she hung a curtain of bark,
and lifted it up carefully whenever she went inside.</p>

<p>At last the new home was ready. The old mother
hurried down to the hollow and called the babies to
come out and follow her. They stepped out, one after
another, just as carefully as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />171<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The smallest baby came last. He dug his claws into
the bark and hung on. The branch seemed so narrow
that he trembled from fear of falling.</p>

<p>The tree swayed in the wind. The branch bounced
up and down, and a leaf blew in his face. The poor
little fellow shut his eyes, because everything seemed
to be whirling round and round.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again he saw the three
other little ones climbing up the trunk above him.
They clutched the bark with their claws, and moved
forward, one paw at a time.</p>

<p>The mother was running on ahead of them. Every
few steps she turned around to coax them on
faster.</p>

<p>Finally they reached a narrow branch which led
over to the new nest. They crawled out on it, lifting
one foot and then setting it down before lifting another.</p>

<p>The farther they crept the narrower the branch
grew under them. Their little paws began to slip
over the smoother bark. The one in front tried to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />172<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
around, but he was afraid of falling. So they all
three scrambled backwards to the safe trunk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 489px;">
<img src="images/i-178.jpg" width="489" height="353" alt="squirrel on branch" />
</div>

<p>The mother ran back to them, and chattered and
scolded. Again and again they started out over the
branch, and then went scrambling back.</p>

<p>When at last the mother had coaxed them across to
the nest she looked around for the smallest baby.
There he was, away down at the door of the old nest.</p>

<p>The old squirrel was tired out. Her fur was ruffled
and her ears drooped. She ran down to the nest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />173<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
began to scold the little fellow. He sat up and put his
paws around her to let him stay there.</p>

<p>But she started him up the trunk and pushed him
along to the branch. Then she took hold of him by
the neck and carried him across to the new
home.</p>

<p>After that the little ones were taken out every
morning to practise climbing. Little by little they
learned to balance themselves on the branches. Their
tails were fluffy enough by this time to be of use in
balancing.</p>

<p>First to one side, then to the other, each baby tilted
his tail as he crept along, step by step. Every day
they could move a little faster. Finally they were able
to chase one another up and down, from branch to
branch.</p>

<p>They went running around the trunks, skipping and
leaping from twig to twig, and jumping from one tree
to another, even through the air.</p>

<p>Sometimes one or another missed his footing after
a reckless jump. Often he caught hold of a branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />174<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
below by a single toe and lifted himself up to a firmer
foothold.</p>

<p>Or, if there was no branch within reach, he spread
out his fur, and flattened his tail, and went sailing down
to the ground, almost as if he could fly. They never
seemed to get hurt.</p>

<p>The little squirrels seemed to be always doing something.
They turned somersaults in the grass, or
swung by one paw from the tip of a tough branch.</p>

<p>There was always something to do or to see. Now
they chattered at a blue jay, or chased a toad for the
fun of watching him hop. Now they caught beetles or
scolded at a fox slinking along through the woods.
And every day there was the excitement of finding
something to eat.</p>

<p>The babies lived on milk till they were almost as
heavy as their mother. Then she began to feed them
with fruit and buds and grubs, which she first chewed
for them.</p>

<p>Like the beavers and the hares and rabbits, each
had four chisel teeth in the front of its mouth. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />175<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
needed to gnaw hard nuts or bark every day to keep
these teeth from growing too long.</p>

<p>The young squirrels were three months old in July
and were then big enough to take care of themselves.
Away they scampered from the old home tree and
found new homes in stumps and hollows. The smallest
one used to curl up in an old robin’s nest to sleep at
night.</p>

<p>All day long they were as busy as they could be.
There were cones to be gathered from the evergreens.
The little squirrels ran up the trees in a hurry, and,
cutting off the cones with their sharp teeth, tossed them
over their shoulders to the ground. Every few minutes
they scurried down to bury the cones under the pine
needles for the winter.</p>

<p>Sometimes a drop of sticky pitch from the cut
stems was rubbed against their fur. That made them
so uncomfortable that they had to stop and lick it
off.</p>

<p>The squirrels loved to be clean. Ever since they
were tiny babies, with their new red fur, they always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />176<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
helped one another with washing their faces and
combing their tails with their claws.</p>

<p>They were careful to run along logs over a muddy
spot. If one happened to get wet he dried himself
with his fluffy tail.</p>

<p>When they were tired of eating seeds and twigs they
hunted for grubs. Clinging to the bark of a dead tree,
they listened till they heard something gnawing
beneath the surface. Then, tearing off the bark in
ragged pieces, they pounced upon the flat whitish
grub beneath and ate him up.</p>

<p>But the best time of all came in the autumn when
nuts were ripe. Then what fun the little squirrels
had! Early every morning out popped the little heads
from the hollow stumps and logs. The big round eyes
twinkled eagerly in every direction. Then, whisk!
they were out, with a bark and a squeak!</p>

<p>Scampering to the top of a tree, each one took a
flying leap to the next tree. Up and down they
followed the squirrel-paths through the woods till they
reached the grove, where the nuts were ripening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />177<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>It was a busy place, with little wings fluttering and
little feet pattering, and yellow leaves drifting down
in the sunshine. All the squirrels scurried to and fro,
picking one nut here, and another there.</p>

<p>They sat on the branches, with their bushy tails
curving over their backs, and held the nuts in their
fore paws to nibble. The smallest baby could open
the hardest walnut and clean it out in less than a
minute.</p>

<p>All the while the blue jays and the thrifty chipmunks
were gathering nuts and corn, and hiding their
stores for the winter. That seemed so interesting that
the squirrels gathered some, too.</p>

<p>Autumn passed away, and the days grew colder.
In the woods the leaves were all fallen and the branches
were stripped bare of nuts.</p>

<p>Every morning when the squirrels poked out their
heads the air nipped their noses. Frost sparkled
on the dead grass. The chipmunks had crept into
their holes for the winter, and most of the birds had
flown away south.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />178<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>The squirrels were not quite so gay now as in the
autumn days, when they danced upon the branches
and whistled and chuckled over the good things to
eat and the curious sights to see. They slept with
their warm tails wrapped over their noses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/i-184.jpg" width="497" height="361" alt="squirrel on ground in snow" />
</div>

<p>They still ran busily through the tree-tops, except
when snow or icy rain kept them shut within their
holes. They ate all the nuts they could find, and dug
up the buried pine cones. They climbed the hemlock
trees and ate the seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />179<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Once the smallest squirrel happened to dig up a
heap of nuts from between two stones under the snow.
He could not remember whether he had hidden them
himself or not. How he squealed when he saw them!</p>

<p>Late in the winter the squirrels had eaten all the
nuts and cones within reach. They were so hungry
on many a day that they tried to creep into a chipmunk’s
hole and steal his store of food. But he was
smaller than they were, and he had wisely made one
bend in his tunnel too small for them to pass.</p>

<p>Then they had to live on bark and seeds till spring
started the tender green plants to growing.</p>

<p>The squirrels gnawed the bark of the maple trees
and drank the sweet sap that came oozing out. Later
there were elm buds to nibble and birds’ eggs to suck.
The woods were once more green with juicy leaves.</p>

<p>All the squirrels went to housekeeping. Soon in
almost every tree there was a family of squirrels peeping
out with their round, bright eyes.</p>

<h2>THE BABY THAT SLEEPS IN A POCKET</h2>


<p>For days and days the baby opossums lay
crowded close together in their mother’s furry pocket.
They slept and drank milk, and grew and grew till their
eyes began to open.</p>

<p>It was dark all around them, but above their heads
a gray line showed where light was stealing in over
the edge of the pocket.</p>

<p>The biggest baby opossum looked up with his
little bright eyes. He wanted to see more. So he
crawled up, clambering over the soft tiny bodies of
the eleven other babies.</p>

<p>Some of them wriggled and squirmed under his little
bare feet. After slipping back once or twice he reached
the edge and poked his pointed white snout outside.</p>

<p>He could not see anything because he was under his
mother, and her long fur hung down over him. She
was lying on a nest of grasses in a hollow tree.</p>

<p>That was where she stayed all day long while the
sun was shining. Every night at dusk she climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />181<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
down the rough trunk and went to hunt for something
to eat.</p>

<p>When she felt the tiny claws of her baby clutching
her fur she looked down between her fore paws at the
little mouse-like fellow.</p>

<p>Then with her smooth pink hands she gently pushed
him back into the pocket and closed the opening. He
was not big enough yet to come out of the warm dark
nursery.</p>

<p>So for a week longer he cuddled down beside the
others, while they all slept and drank more milk and
grew stronger every hour.</p>

<p>The biggest baby was so restless that he scrambled
around and crowded the others. Once he caught
hold of a tiny tail between the thumbs and fingers
of his hind feet, and pulled till the little one squeaked.
His fore feet were like tiny hands without any thumbs.</p>

<p>At last, one day, he saw the edge of the pocket open
a crack. He was so glad that he climbed up as fast
as he could scramble, and pushed outside. He held
on to his mother’s fur with all four feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />182<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>When she reached down to smell him the bristles
on her lips tickled his nose. Then he climbed around
upon her back and twisted his tail about hers to hold
him steady.</p>

<p>He looked like a mouse with his long tail, his black
ears, his bright eyes twinkling in his little white face,
and his pointed nose.</p>

<p>In a few minutes another and another baby followed
the big brother and clung there on the mother’s furry
back. It must have seemed a noisy place to them,
for in the pocket they had heard only the soft rustling
and scratching of the mother’s feet on the nest.</p>

<p>Now they could hear a chirping, and a squeaking,
and a rattling of branches. They crowded close
together in fright at the scream of a blue jay, as it
chased a chattering red squirrel through the tree-top.</p>

<p>Then a sudden loud thump—thump—thump of
a woodpecker hammering on the bark of the tree
sent them tumbling back to the nursery in a
hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />183<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>After this the whole family climbed out every day
to play about on the mother’s back. The biggest
baby liked to curl his small tail about her large one,
and then swing off head downward.</p>

<p>Sometimes he pushed the others down just for the
fun of seeing them scramble up again, hand over
hand, clutching the long fur.</p>

<p>Of course he was the first one to poke his head out
every day. Once he woke from a nap in the pocket
and started to climb outside.</p>

<p>But he stopped halfway, hanging to the edge with
both fore feet. It was nearly evening, and the mother
opossum was clambering down the tree-trunk to
go hunting for her supper.</p>

<p>The baby held on tightly while she trotted away
through the woods. Now and then a leaf rustled
or a stick cracked under her feet. Sleepy birds were
twittering in their nests.</p>

<p>The mother pricked her ears and listened, for she
ate eggs and young birds whenever she could find
them. She had not tasted an egg this spring, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />184<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
she could not climb very nimbly with her pocket
full of babies.</p>

<p>Soon she came to a swamp, and splash, splash, splash!
the mud went flying. It spattered the baby’s face
and made him cough.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 462px;">
<img src="images/i-190.jpg" width="462" height="340" alt="possum in moonlight" />
</div>

<p>Then he heard the croakings of dozens of frogs,
and it frightened him so that he slid back into the
nursery with his brothers.</p>

<p>The mother was trying to catch a frog to eat. Now
she jumped this way, and now she jumped that way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />185<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
Such a jounce as the babies felt when she gave a
spring for a big green fellow sitting on a log.</p>

<p>She caught him, too, but the jounce almost knocked
the breath out of the twelve soft bodies in her pocket.</p>

<p>Every day the babies stayed outside the nursery
for a longer time, though they were always ready
to hurry back at the mother’s first warning grunt.</p>

<p>They kept growing bigger, too, till one night they
could not all crowd into the pocket. Then they
cuddled together on her back, with their tails twisted
around hers.</p>

<p>In this way they rode through the woods when she
went hunting. They watched with their bright
eyes while she turned over rotting logs with her snout
to catch the grubs underneath.</p>

<p>Sometimes she rooted in the ground for sprouting
acorns, or nipped off mouthfuls of tender grass. Once
she caught a young rabbit. Then how excited the
little opossums were! And how they all squeaked
and hissed together as they rode trotting home.</p>

<p>By this time they had cut their teeth,—fifty sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />186<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
little teeth in each hungry mouth. Then the mother
picked some sweet red berries, and taught the hungry
babies how to eat them. They learned to chew the
juicy roots that she dug in the field.</p>

<p>The babies were greedy little things. She was a
good and patient mother. Of course, as long as they
were small enough to stay in her pocket she carried
them everywhere with her. Even when they grew as
large as rats they rode on her back through the woods.
These twelve fat babies were so heavy that sometimes
she staggered and stumbled under the load.</p>

<p>One night when all the babies were trotting along
on their own feet they saw gleaming red eyes in the
dark bushes before them. Something round and furry
snarled and sprang at them.</p>

<p>They all ran under their mother as quick as a wink.
She ruffled her long grayish hair above them. When
the animal jumped at her she growled, and hissed,
and scratched, and bit, till he ran limping away.</p>

<p>On another evening a big dog came galloping up
before they could scramble into a tree. His red tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />187<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
was hanging out of his mouth between his white teeth.
As soon as he caught sight of the opossums he made
a dash to catch them. Instantly they all fell down and
rolled over just as if they were dead.</p>

<p>There they lay, with their eyes shut, their paws
limber, their tails limp. They seemed to stop breathing.
The dog smelled them and pushed them with
his cold nose.</p>

<p>But they kept perfectly still and did not move even
an eyelash. They were pretending to be dead. It
was one trick that they all knew without being taught.</p>

<p>The minute the dog walked away they all jumped
up and scampered into a tree. When the dog turned
his head and saw them he ran back and leaped up
to reach them.</p>

<p>But all the opossums were safe enough now. While
he was jumping and barking below they clung fast
in the tree with their hand-like feet. They wound
their tails about the branches above to hold more
securely.</p>

<p>The little opossums learned to climb all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />188<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
trees, rough or smooth. It was easier to climb the
rough trees because they could dig their nails farther
into the bark.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i-194.jpg" width="461" height="339" alt="hanging upside down by tail" />
</div>

<p>The biggest baby could walk along the springiest
limb, even if it kept teetering up and down in the
wind. When he felt like it he swung by his tail the
longest time without getting dizzy.</p>

<p>All summer long the twelve little opossums stayed
with their mother. During the day they slept cuddled
in the hollow tree. Every night, after sunset,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />189<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
the mother and her twelve children set off on their
hunting.</p>

<p>Down through the marsh they trotted. Some
waded into the mud to catch frogs, while others
chased mud turtles over the shore. Some hunted
for berries and others nosed for acorns under the oaks.</p>

<p>It was beautiful there in the woods at night. When
the stars twinkled overhead and the soft wind rustled
in the tree-tops the little ones frisked and frolicked.</p>

<p>They hid under the shadowy bushes or jumped
hither and thither to snap at the fluttering
moths.</p>

<p>But on stormy evenings they plodded on in the
rain, their wet fur drooping. With their noses close
to the ground they hunted till they found a few
mouthfuls to eat. Then they went back to the cosy
hollow for a longer nap, after licking their pink hands
and washing their faces, just as kittens do.</p>

<p>One night, in autumn, the old mother opossum
felt the nip of frost in the air. Then she knew that
the persimmons were ready to be eaten. Away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />190<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
through the woods she hurried, with the young ones
trotting after her.</p>

<p>She led the way past the marsh and over the
hill to a thicket of trees tangled with wild grapevines.
There on the branches the round persimmons
were shining yellow in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Up the trees eleven of the babies scrambled hungrily,
and, hanging by their tails, stuffed the fruit into their
wide mouths. Ah! But wasn’t it delicious! Better
than anything they had ever tasted before in all their
short lives.</p>

<p>Then the biggest baby, who had stopped to gobble
ripe grapes, heard them munching so greedily. One
look sent him hurrying after the others. He was
sorry enough that he had wasted any time eating
wild grapes.</p>

<p>Night after night, till the little persimmons were
gone, the opossums hurried away to the thicket, and
ate and ate till they could eat no longer. They grew
so fat that they puffed and panted when trotting
home again in the gray light of the frosty dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />191<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Soon the ground was frozen hard over the juicy
roots. All the fruit left in the woods hung wrinkled
and frost-bitten. The worms and toads crawled into
their holes for the winter. The beetles disappeared,
and the spiders curled up in their hiding places to
sleep through the cold weather. Most of the birds
flew away south.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i-196.jpg" width="461" height="340" alt="possum on ground at base of tree in forest" />
</div>

<p>One by one each little opossum wandered off by
himself, and made a nest in a cosy hole or a hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />192<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
stump. There he dozed all day and often slept through
the night without stirring out.</p>

<p>Now and then one of them caught a mouse or dug
up a frozen root to nibble. Sometimes they tore
rotten logs apart to get at the grubs.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the winter the little opossums
were so fat that they could live three or four weeks
without eating or drinking. When the cold winds blew,
and the snow fell, they cuddled down in their warm
nests and slept the time away. But many a night
they woke up hungry. And every day their round
furry bodies were a little thinner, till at last, spring
melted the snow and ice everywhere.</p>

<p>There was plenty to eat by that time, with all the
green things growing. There were buds to nibble
and beetles to catch. There were frogs croaking in
the marsh, and berries were ripening in the field.</p>

<p>The twelve little opossums were grown up now,
and knew how to take care of themselves. Their
mother had another family of babies in her furry
pocket.</p>

<p>Sometimes she met her other children roaming beside
the marsh to catch frogs. One evening they saw
a little pointed nose, and two twinkling bright eyes,
peeping over the edge of her pocket.</p>

<h2>THE EMPEROR AND THE PEASANT</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was an Emperor of China,
named Lee Wong. He would have been a very good
Emperor if he had not been spoiled by kindness.</p>

<p>If he cried when he was a baby, his nurse called
all the nurses in the palace.</p>

<p>They called the attendants, and the attendants
called the musicians. The musicians played, the
attendants danced, and the nurses walked up and
down wheeling the baby in his carriage until he
stopped crying. Sometimes this happened many
times in one day.</p>

<p>When Lee was a boy he had his own way in everything.
If he played soldier he was always the general.
If he went to fly kites, he had the ones that would
fly the highest.</p>

<p>Sometimes he wished to fly his kites when the wind
did not blow. Then the poor attendants had to blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />195<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
with a huge bellows to make the kites sail up into the
air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/i-201.jpg" width="465" height="343" alt="Child holding up kite, man on ground holding bellows" />
</div>

<p>If he wished it were summer in the winter-time,
they filled his playroom with beautiful plants and
brought canaries and nightingales to sing to him.</p>

<p>In the hot summer days, if he longed for winter,
they brought evergreen trees to the playroom. They
covered the branches with cotton sprinkled with
diamond dust to look like snow. They brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />196<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
cakes of ice and made a skating rink and jingled sleigh
bells all day long while he played.</p>

<p>When he was a young man it was still worse. If
he said anything, like, “This is a sunny morning,”
or “I think it will rain to-night,” every one cried,
“How wise!” “How wonderfully wise!”</p>

<p>So you see the Emperor was spoiled, and this was
very unfortunate.</p>

<p>In China, just as in other places, every one longs
for spring to come.</p>

<p>One year the Emperor wanted the spring to come
more than ever. He had had a dull winter in his
city palace and he wanted to go to his country palace.</p>

<p>“Command my brother, the Sun, to shine to-morrow,”
he said, to his attendants. “Command
the spring to come, also. And be ready, all of you,
to go to the country to-morrow.”</p>

<p>One of the attendants wrote the Emperor’s commands
on the finest Chinese paper and then burned
it in the garden. He thought in this way the commands
might reach the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />197<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps they did; for the sun shone beautifully
the next day, and the Emperor and his attendants
went to the country palace.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The next morning the Emperor waked up very early.
A little bird was singing in the garden. It was a
lovely day.</p>

<p>The Emperor thought he would go out into the
garden to hear the little bird sing.</p>

<p>He put on his silk dressing-gown, his silver shoes,
and his gold crown. It was only six o’clock, so no
one was awake in the palace.</p>

<p>When the Emperor went into the garden the bird
flew into the forest and sang still more sweetly.</p>

<p>“How stupid I was,” thought the Emperor, “I
ought to have commanded it to stay here. Now I
must go into the woods to see it.”</p>

<p>So he opened the gate and went across the field.</p>

<p>At the edge of the woods a peasant was plowing.</p>

<p>“Good morning, peasant,” said the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />198<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
“That must be an Emperor bird singing in the forest,
because it sings so sweetly.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” said the peasant, taking off his cap,
“that is a blackbird.”</p>

<p>“You may call it so,” said the Emperor; “but
it is an Emperor bird if I say so, because I am always
right. It is as large as a swan, and its feathers are like
shining gold.”</p>

<p>“No, my lord,” said the peasant, “it is small and
black.”</p>

<p>Just then the blackbird lighted on a post in the
fence and began to sing. It was easy to see that the
peasant was right.</p>

<p>“There must surely be something wrong,” said the
Emperor, “because I never make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But, my lord, the Emperor can make a mistake.
Every one does that. Your attendants may say
that you are always right because they wish to please
you. Perhaps they even praise what you do, when
it is wrong and foolish.”</p>

<p>“I can never believe that,” said the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />199<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“If you will do as I say,” replied the peasant,
“I will prove that I have told you the truth.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The Emperor promised to do this, although he could
not believe he had been deceived.</p>

<p>Just then all the attendants came running across
the field, for they had waked up and missed the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Tears ran down their cheeks. They wished to have
the Emperor think they were weeping because he was
gone. He did not know each one had an onion in his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Command them to stop where they are,” the
peasant whispered.</p>

<p>The Emperor made them stop about twenty feet
away, right in the middle of a ditch.</p>

<p>“We are weeping because of your absence, beloved
Emperor,” said the chief attendant. He wiped his
eyes with his handkerchief, and all the others did
the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />200<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“How do you dare to stand beside the Emperor,
you peasant,” said the Lord Marshal. “Go back
to your plow!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/i-206.jpg" width="463" height="338" alt="Emperor, peasant and plow" />
</div>

<p>“Say that I am standing beside my plow,” whispered
the peasant. He was really standing beside the
Emperor, and the plow was thirty feet away.</p>

<p>“Do you not see,” said the Emperor, “that he is
standing beside the plow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said one, “he is holding the plow with
one hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />201<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said another, “he is surely driving
his oxen.”</p>

<p>“Ask them,” whispered the peasant, “if they
ever saw such white oxen.”</p>

<p>Now the peasant’s oxen were coal black, without a
single white spot on them.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen such beautiful white oxen?”
said the Emperor, pointing to the black ones.</p>

<p>“No, never,” said one, “they are indeed snow
white.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said another, “they are whiter than snow.
It hurts my eyes to look at them, they are so white.”</p>

<p>The Emperor knew now that they were not telling
the truth, and he decided to punish them.</p>

<p>“Come here,” he called to some peasants who were
plowing in the next field.</p>

<p>“There is nothing so pleasant as plowing,” he said
to his attendants.</p>

<p>“It is a great pleasure,” said one.</p>

<p>“I enjoy it more than anything in the world,” said
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />202<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“I would rather plow than dance,” said a third.</p>

<p>“I am very glad you think so, my lords,” said the
Emperor. “These peasants will be glad to have you
plow for them. This is my command. Begin at
once!”</p>

<p>There was no help for it. The courtiers did not
dare to disobey, so they took hold of the plows and
tried to drive the oxen across the long fields.</p>

<p>I do not believe they plowed very well, for they had
never touched a plow before, and did not know how
to drive oxen.</p>

<p>But the peasant went to the palace and became the
Emperor’s chief counsellor.</p>

<p>The Emperor had this story written on a block
of marble in golden letters, but few people can read
it because it is written in Chinese, and it is very hard
to have to read Chinese.</p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS MONKS</h2>


<h3>I—THE GARDEN</h3>

<p>Have you always wondered where the Christmas
presents come from? Well, I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>Of course, every one knows that Santa Claus brings
them. He comes in a sleigh, driving eight reindeer,
and carries the presents down the chimney in a pack
on his back.</p>

<p>But where does <i>he</i> get them? That is the question.
And the answer is,—in the garden of the Christmas
Monks.</p>

<p>This garden is in a beautiful valley far away. But I
must not tell you the name of the valley, for if I did
you would all want to go there to live.</p>

<p>The Christmas Monks live in a stone castle covered
with ivy and evergreen vines. There are holly wreaths
in every window, and over the door is an arch, with
“Merry Christmas” in evergreen letters.</p>

<p>The Christmas Monks wear white robes embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />204<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
with gold, and they never go without a Christmas
wreath on their heads. Every morning they sing a
Christmas carol, and every evening they ring a
Christmas chime on the bells.</p>

<p>For dinner every day they have roast goose and
plum pudding and mince pie, and at night they set
lighted candles in all of the windows.</p>

<p>But the best place of all is the garden, for that is
where the Christmas presents grow.</p>

<p>It is a very large garden and is divided into beds,
just like our vegetable gardens. Every spring the
Monks go out to plow the ground and plant the Christmas
present seeds.</p>

<p>There is one big bed for rocking-horses, another
for drums, and another for sleds. The bed for the
balls is not so large, and the top bed is quite
small, because tops do not need much room when
they are growing.</p>

<p>The rocking-horse seed looks like tiny rocking-horses.
The Monks drop these seeds quite far apart,
then they cover them up neatly with earth, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />205<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
up a signpost with “Rocking-horses” on it in evergreen
letters.</p>

<p>Just so with the penny-trumpet seed, and the toy-furniture
seed, the sled seed, and all the others.</p>

<p>Perhaps the prettiest part of the garden is the
wax-doll bed. There are other beds for the rag dolls
and the china dolls, and the rubber dolls, but, of
course, wax dolls look much handsomer growing.</p>

<p>Wax dolls have to be planted very early in the
season. The Monks sow them in rows in April and
they begin to come up by the middle of May.</p>

<p>First there is a glimmer of gold, or brown, or black
hair. Then the snowy foreheads appear, and the
blue eyes and black eyes, and at last all the pretty
heads are out of the ground and nodding and smiling
to each other.</p>

<p>With their pink cheeks and bright eyes and curly
hair, there is nothing so pretty as these little wax-doll
heads peeping out of the ground.</p>

<p>Slowly the dolls grow taller and taller, and by
Christmas they are all ready to gather. There they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />206<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
stand, swaying to and fro, their dresses of pink or
blue or white fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>Just about the prettiest sight in the world is the
bed of wax dolls in the garden of the Christmas Monks
at Christmas time.</p>


<h3>II—PETER AND THE PRINCE</h3>

<p>All the children for miles around knew about this
garden, of course, but they had never seen it. There
is a thick hedge of Christmas trees all around it, and
the gate where Santa Claus drives out is always locked
with a golden key the moment he goes through.</p>

<p>So you can imagine what excitement there was
among the boys when this notice was hung out on the
hedge of Christmas trees:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Wanted:</i>—By the Christmas Monks, two <i>good</i> boys to help in
garden work. Apply at the garden on April tenth.</p></div>

<p>The notice was hung out about five o’clock in the
evening, one day in February. By noon the next day
all the neighborhood had seen it and read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />207<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>Oh, what fun it would be to work in the garden of
the Christmas Monks! There would be the dinner
of roast goose and plum pudding every day. There
would be the Christmas bells and the Christmas
candles every night. And, of course, one could have
all the toys he wanted, and pick them out himself.</p>

<p>So, from that very minute until the tenth of April,
the boys were as good,—as good as gold.</p>

<p>Then, on the tenth of April, the big Santa Claus
gate was opened, and <i>such</i> a crowd poured into the
garden! The ground was plowed, but the seed had
not been planted, so they could walk about everywhere.</p>

<p>Two of the Christmas Monks sat on a throne trimmed
so thick with evergreens that it looked like a bird’s
nest. They wore Christmas wreaths on their heads,
and their eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>The little boys stood in a long row before them,
and the fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, grandmothers,
and grandfathers looked on.</p>

<p>It was very sad! One boy had taken eggs from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />208<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
bird’s nest; and another had frightened a cat. One
boy didn’t help his mother, and another didn’t take
good care of his little brother.</p>

<p>At last there were only two boys left,—Peter and
the Prince.</p>

<p>Now Peter was really and truly a good boy, and
always had been. And of course every one said the
Prince was a good boy, because a King’s son must
be good. So the Monks chose Peter and the Prince
to work in the garden.</p>

<p>The next morning the two boys were dressed in
white robes and green wreaths like the Monks. Then
the Prince was sent to plant Noah’s-Ark seed and
Peter was given picture-book seed.</p>

<p>Up and down they went, scattering the seeds.
Peter sang a little song to himself, but the Prince
grumbled because they had not given him gold-watch
seed.</p>

<p>By noon Peter had planted all his picture books and
fastened up the card to mark them, but the Prince
had planted only two rows of Noah’s Arks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />209<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>“We are going to have trouble with this boy,”
said the Monks to each other. “We shall have to
punish him.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/i-215.jpg" width="465" height="343" alt="finished planting" />
</div>

<p>So that day the Prince had no Christmas dinner,
and the next morning he finished planting the Noah’s-Ark
seed.</p>

<p>But the very next day he was cross because he had
to sow harmonicas instead of toy pianos, and had to
be punished again. And so it was every other day
through the whole summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />210<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>So the Prince was very unhappy and wished he
could run away, but Peter had never been so happy
in his life. He worked like a bee all day, and loved
to watch the Christmas gifts grow and blossom.</p>

<p>“They grow so slowly,” the Prince would say.
“I thought I should have a bushel of new toys every
month and not one have I had yet.” Then he would
cry, and Peter would try to comfort him.</p>

<p>At last one day the Prince found a ladder in the
tool house. The Monks were in the chapel, singing
Christmas carols, and Peter was tuning the penny
trumpets. It was a fine chance to run away. The
Prince put the ladder against the Santa Claus gate,
climbed up to the top, and slid down on the outside.</p>


<h3>III—THE PRETTIEST DOLL</h3>

<p>It was nearly Christmas now, and most of the toys
had been gathered. The rocking-horses were still
growing, and a few of the largest dolls; but the
tops, balls, guns, blocks, and drums were all packed
in baskets ready for Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />211<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span></p>

<p>One morning Peter was in the wax-doll bed, dusting
the dolls. All of a sudden he heard a sweet voice
saying, “Oh, Peter!”</p>

<p>He thought at first it was one of the dolls, but they
could only say “Papa!” and “Mamma!”</p>

<p>“Here I am, Peter,” said the voice again, and what
do you suppose Peter saw? It was his own dear little
lame sister.</p>

<p>She was not any taller than the dolls around her,
and she looked just like one of them with her pink
cheeks and yellow hair. She stood there on her
crutches, poor little thing, smiling lovingly at Peter.</p>

<p>“Oh, you darling,” cried Peter, catching her up
in his arms. “How did you get in here?”</p>

<p>“I saw one of the Monks going past our house,
so I ran out and followed him. When he came through
the gate I came in, too, but he did not see me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Peter, “I don’t see what I can do
with you. I can’t let you out, because the gate is
locked, and I don’t know what the Monks will say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know!” cried the little girl. “I’ll stay out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />212<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
here in the garden. I can sleep every night in one of
those beautiful dolls’ cradles over there, and you can
bring me something to eat.”</p>

<p>“But the Monks come out every morning to look
at the Christmas gifts, and they will see you,” said
her brother.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll hide! Oh, Peter, here is a place where
there isn’t any doll.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that doll didn’t come up.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do! I’ll stand here
where the doll didn’t come up and try to look like
one.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can do that,” said Peter. He was
such a good boy that he didn’t want to do anything
wrong, but he couldn’t help being glad to see his
dear little sister.</p>

<p>He took food out to her every day, and she helped
him in the garden. At night he tucked her into one
of the dolls’ cradles with lace pillows and a quilt of
rose-colored silk.</p>

<p>So they went on, day after day, and they were just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />213<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
as happy as they could be. Finally the day came
for gathering the very last of the Christmas gifts,
because in six days it would be Christmas, and Santa
Claus had to start out in a day or two.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i-219.jpg" width="461" height="344" alt="boy  and lame sister" />
</div>

<p>So the Monks went into the garden to be sure that
everything was perfect, and one of them wore his
spectacles. When he came to the bed where the
biggest dolls were growing, there stood Peter’s sister,
smiling and swinging on her crutches.</p>

<p>“Why, what is that!” said the Monk. “I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />214<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
that doll didn’t come up. There is a doll there—and
a doll on crutches, too.”</p>

<p>Then he put out his hand to touch the doll and
she jumped,—she couldn’t help it. The Monk
jumped too, and his Christmas wreath fell off his head.</p>

<p>“The doll is alive!” he exclaimed. “I will pick
her and show her to my brothers.”</p>

<div class="caption">THE GOOD FATHER TOOK PETER’S LITTLE SISTER, CRUTCHES AND ALL,
IN HIS ARMS.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the good father put on his Christmas wreath,
took Peter’s little sister, crutches and all, in his arms,
and carried her into the chapel.</p>


<h3>IV—CHRISTMAS GIFTS</h3>

<p>Soon the Monks came into the chapel to practise
singing some new Christmas carols. There sat the
near-sighted Monk, holding the big doll in his arms.</p>

<p>“Behold a miracle,” he said, holding up the doll.
“Thou wilt remember that there was one doll planted
which did not come up. Behold, in her place I have
found this doll on crutches, which is—alive!”</p>

<p>“It is indeed a miracle,” said the Monk who was a
doctor. He took the child in his arms and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />215<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
at the twisted ankle. “I think I can cure this lameness,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Take her, then,” said the abbot, “and we will
sing our Christmas carols joyously in her honor.”</p>

<p>Peter, of course, heard the Monks talking about the
miracle, and he knew what it meant. He was very
unhappy to think that he was deceiving them. At
the same time he did not dare to tell them for fear
the doctor would not try to cure his sister.</p>

<p>He worked hard picking the Christmas presents,
and getting them ready for Santa Claus.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve he was called into the chapel.
The walls were covered with evergreen, and Christmas
candles shone everywhere. There were Christmas
wreaths in all the windows, and the Monks were
singing a Christmas carol.</p>

<p>On a chair covered with green branches sat Peter’s
little sister, dressed in white, with a wreath of holly
berries on her head.</p>

<p>When the carol was ended, the Monks formed in
a line with the abbot at the head. Each one had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />216<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
hands full of the most beautiful Christmas presents.
The abbot held a wax doll, the biggest and prettiest
that grew in the garden.</p>

<p>When he held it out to the little girl, she drew back,
and said in her sweet little voice, “Please, I’m not a
miracle; I’m only Peter’s little sister.”</p>

<p>“Peter?” said the abbot; “the Peter who works
in our garden?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the little sister.</p>

<p>The Monks looked at each other in dismay. This
was not a miracle, it was only Peter’s little sister!</p>

<p>But the abbot of the Christmas Monks spoke to
them. “This little girl did not come up in the place
of the wax doll, and she is not a miracle. But she
is sweet and beautiful, and we all love her.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Christmas Monks, and they laid
their presents down before her.</p>

<p>Peter was so happy he danced for joy. And when
he found his little sister was cured of her lameness,
he did not know what to do.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he took his sister and went home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"><img src="images/page_deco-l.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" />217<img src="images/page_deco-r.jpg" width="17" height="12" alt="decoration" /></a></span>
to see his father and mother. Santa Claus filled his
sleigh with gifts and drove his reindeer down to the
cottage.</p>

<p>Oh! it was such a happy day. There was so much
to tell that they all talked at once. There was so
much to see that their eyes ached with looking.</p>

<p>But in the palace of the King it was very different.
The Prince was cross and unhappy. His old toys were
broken. He was tired of his old games. There was no
one for him to play with, and he didn’t have one
single Christmas gift.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
